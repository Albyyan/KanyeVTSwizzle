line
So many things that I forgot to say
Will tell you its true
In front of everyone you know
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
The rain didnt soak through my clothes down to my skin
Dont know whats down this road Im just walking
Sittin on the fence posts
I wanna stay right here in this passengers seat
Hey
There youll stand ten feet tall
Silent night holy night
Trying to get my heels back under my head
The best people in life are free
Well now hes back in the atmosphere
Shes got her magic
Lets talk about what you did to get here
But you carry my groceries and now Im always laughin
But Im keeping warm somehow
Did you not write it down
When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Good
Oh let me think Im strong
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
A tear came to her eye
Never fadeLook at you
I havent read it a thousand times
Blew down the doors to let me in
Its like no matter what I do
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Just like all those times before
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bridetobe
Feel the fear in my enemys eyes
All around your feet
Hold on make it last
When we first dropped our bags on
Not like this
I got a lump in my throat because youre gonna sing the words wrongI remember your bare feet down the hallway
Its miserable and magical
Dont you think I was too young
22 oohooh oh oh oh
But I took your matches
Winds of change blew you away from me
Cause coming back around here
I dont wanna need you this way
And you said my point exactly
And I lived in your chess game
Every smile you fake is so condescending
You say sorry just for show
All those other girls
There was something wrong it was all my fault
How you said youd be here
And this year
You walk around here thinking youre not pretty
Theres a glow off the pavement
But youre just so cool
You see me in hindsight
And I dont think we can solve them
And tomorrows just a mystery oh yeah
Halleluia
Too in love to think straight
There wasnt much love to lose
I wish youd could only see
She was an American girl
I dont wanna lose your face
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Counting every bird
You say sorry just for show
And this is when the feeling sinks in
Flew me to places Id never been
Let it take me where it wants to go
What I wanted
And everybodys here
Down came the rain
And risk another goodbye
But I didnt know it at fifteen
To write on his heart
He cant keep his wild eyes on the road
And when I got home  fore I said amen
Everything has changed
Wed never fight
But if this was a movie youd be here by now
Holding on
And TPizzle TPizzle
Dont look at me
And how you held me in your arms that September night
Through a night alone
But loves got me cornered in the back of the room
With lots of places to run to
We found wonderland
If I wasnt scared of the world alone
Laughing at the other girls who think theyre so cool
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
They take their shots but were bulletproof
Kiss me on the sidewalk
And didnt they pray too
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I cant say Hello to you
In wonderland
Oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
This time Im flying free
Cause baby now we got bad blood hey
Of who can act like they care less
With every single move
Id rather do
It feels just like a day
All I know since yesterday is everything has changedI said Oh my what a marvelous tune
Dont you look now
I can still see you this aint the best view
I should have known I should have known
Heartbreakers gonna break break break break break mmmm
Well be out of here as soon as we can
This is the last time Im asking you this
Mmm I cant help myself
Wildest dreams ahha ohh
Merry Christmas I wrapped it up and sent it
Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
The girl in the dress
He tells lies are you really thinking
Lighthearted joke
Oh yeahYou take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
But none of us want to get there too soon
And as we walked
Angels fly in the air tonight
You say that the past is the past you need one chance
Whos really bad at lying
This is the worthwhile fight
Am I right
And Im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me yeah
Thinking about him
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
Ill be right here on the ground
Got em up to there
This is really happening
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
The way you look the way you laugh
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye
Say that well be together
And i dont wanna lose your face
Cause our song is the slamming screen door
It takes everything in me not to call you
Will my love come in a pouring rain
I know Im laughing on the car ride home with you
One night he wakes
And i dont wanna wake one day
And theres so much that I cant touch
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
And Ill never never be the same
A long drive
I hear your laugh
Oh what you get is what you see
If thats what you need
Wildest dreams ahha ohh
Until Brad Pitt comes along
What you want from the stars
And tell me
Thats the closest youll see me
Oh take it easy now
and right before your eyes
Saw you there and I thought
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And Im making you hear me laugh like I just dont care
We drive around town in a rusty old truck
And I just wanna tell you
Thats how you lost the girl
Its alright just wait and see
We were gonna buy someday
Cause you can hear it in the silence
You were never good enough for him
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Theres your trouble
Cause baby now we got bad blood
Because I think I need one
Oh what you get is what you see
You would you would if this was a movie
Looking out into the great unknown
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore
I didnt bring her up
This love is alive back from the dead
And I stare at the phone
Well Ill wait up for you dear santa baby
You and Ill be safe and sound
This daydream is dangerous
Youre better off youre better off
I can feel my heart
Even if its just in your wildest dreams ahha
Of all the years that we stood there
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
That Im only up when youre not down
When youre standing on a mountain
Got a long list of exlovers
To hold you
And we were happy
Spoke a million words
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
Saying Its gonna be alright
If you could see
Jump then fall into me
Shell expose you when she snows you
My love
To get knocked off our feet
But if you look at me right now
Radiant beams from thy holy face
And Ive been hoping every day
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
Singer turned gangster
Talking over a football game
I hope it takes you back to that place
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Oh dont fade away baby
You hand me a rose and a note that says
Got a long list of exlovers
I shake it off I shake it off
Got me feeling like a nothing
Feels like Im fallin and I am lost in your eyes
Was she worth this
We thought were stars
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
Cause thats where you belong
Ill never judge you
On the mattress whoa
And I guess I wished on a plane
Everything will be alright
Ill just wait for the day
Well count to ten take it in
So you can feel whole inside
I used to let you choose
Im sorry oh
On the
Whydo you have to make me feel small
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
But youre still gone gone gone
Before he taught me how to lie
Im standing there on a balcony in summer air
When Im in this dream
Through paychecks in tip jars yeah
Tonight Im hosting SNL
And thats what they dont see mmmmmm
Im caught up in you Im caught up in you
I hold onto the night
Itll leave you breathless
Little that I knew
Cant remember what song it was playing when we walked in
but you take one look at me
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
Since I fell in love with this here guitar
Soaking wet
A beautiful magic love there
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
And it would be a fine proposition
When you started cryin baby I did too
Down came the rain
And I could tell you now
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Things are meant to happen like this
Ill follow you follow you home
Tell me what would you find
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
My missionaries in a foreign field
I was enchanted to meet you
When you said you needed space What
Cause Im still trying to figure it out
Ooh just wanna stay right here
Im a cell phone hippie
I looked at you like the stars that shined
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Everybody knows that
Had me in the palm of your hand
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oh ohLets watch
Its a love story baby just say Yes
Oh
They say Ive always known
Didnt matter where Id been
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
Maybe shell bring you into the skies
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Living on a prayer
You were my best four years
Id rather take a blow
Your name forever the name on my lips
Cant you read between the lines
Oh yeah
But the very next day you gave it away
All you had to do was stay
and if you ever need love Im standing at your door
Just because youre clean dont mean you dont miss it
I shake it off I shake it off
All you have to do is let me know
But the very next day you gave it away
And I still think about back when
Will my love come in a bowl of fire
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
Looking out the window
Let me tell you now youre the lucky one oh oh oh
And every time you shine I shine
Singing long live all the mountains we moved
Dont be afraid to
Its my turn to be me
But the very next day you gave it away
I cant decide if its a choice
Thats what I learned from you oh you oh
Uh uh
Look at what weve found
No apologies Hell never see you cry
And youve still got it in your drawer even now
With your best friend he always liked me anyway
Im the one who makes you laugh
Take me back when our world was one block wide
Same old tired lonely place
Really weird
But I think that its best if we both stay
And the oceans had your eyes
Shell still sing the same old songs
Youre just another picture to burn
Welcome distraction
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
In dark blue Tennessee
You could do better thats what she says
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
You picking on the weaker man
Come on come on
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Up until the nights got cold
You lift my feet off the ground
In words that nobody knows
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
And long long live the look on your face
Still thinking were together
Cause Every time you smile I smile
On all my wasted time
Cause baby you were so damn cute
Confetti falls to the ground
I could dance to this beat beat
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
And i dont wanna wake one day
You make me crazier crazier
And the message that I left when I called
I wanna be your left hand man
You were in college working part time waiting tables
Do you know when you go
Peace love
Youre a redneck heartbreak
On our last night
Cause I remember those times
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Begging you Please dont go
His sisters beautiful he has his fathers eyes
My faith in you was fading
All you had to do was stay
Dont be afraid to
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Welcome distraction welcome distraction oh ohWhat do you say when you just know
Raised on promises
And everybody knows that
But that was when I ruled the worldIf you had only gotten to me first
Late to do anything
The first date Man I didnt kiss her when I should have
Will my love come in a pouring rain
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
La la la la la la la
When I mess up I dont get up
Standing there all waiting on me
They say Ive always known
Be there never gonna leave you
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
Where everybody stands and keeps score
But in case you havent heard the news
School dance first chance
It will be a long time long time going going
I wish you would I wish you would
And you made it so real
Gonna climb the mountain
Im breaking no past
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
And we held them up for our town
Ill be sick inside if baby you would be my cure
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
Just when our love was like a burning flame
All I know is a new found grace
My hands shake
In red lipstick
Just like our last kiss
The way you cuss
Now I just wanna be alone
That Ive come too far to go back there again
But nobodys listening
Yeah oh yeah
Its like a kaleidoscope of memories
My mind is like an island
Mmm mmm mmm
But we are never ever ever ever getting back togetherIm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I guess heard you wrong
And thats the way I loved you
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Before you ask me if im alright
Let them say what they want we wont hear it
He always said he didnt get this song
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
As you held her so close
Searching for a sound we hadnt
The only reason is youre seeing how much better off he is
Its like Im melting on into you
I am not the kind of girl
Even now just looking at you feels wrong
Its like we dont remember
But I am not alone
Its been waiting for you
And yeah I might go with it
He says everything I need to hear and its like
When it comes to you
A hometown number one
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Dont mind Gracie
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know youre wrong
All the girls in the front row scream your name
All I know is we said Hello
Washed my sins on the neon lights
Cause Im so mad I might tell you that its over
Hes got a song that moves along
Has seen all through
And we run
All the girls that youve run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Maybe we wont
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
But I have to
I know places
And Im like I just I mean this is exhausting you know like
Say youll see me again
And by morning gone was any trace of you
Come back come back come back to me like
Shes better known
Thats when I could finally breathe
Heres to you and your temper
But not like this
It rains when youre here
Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why
Did you think wed be fine Still got scars on my back from your knife
I dont wanna miss you like this
But the start of an age
I didnt know who I was supposed to be at fifteen
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
You took a Polaroid of us
You can tell me when its over
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter
If you could see the way your smile looks to me
And thats the way I loved you oh oh
I gotta have you
We sing it proudly
Running around in circles
Remember how that lasted for a day
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
And Im only me
Shes not a saint
But you came along and you changed everything
So you might as well sit back
You make me crazier crazier crazier
You were holdin my hand when the car pulled up for you
All the better just to please you
And I waited so frustrated
Think about the good times
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Oh my what a marvelous tune
Its really weird
Come on baby with me were gonna fly away from here
We were gonna buy someday
You screamed and ran after it
This I have previously learned
In my monologue
I could tell you now but never mind
Its hard to fight when the fight aint fair
Youre all I wanted
And the storys got dust on every page
Bye bye baby
cause its late and your mama dont know
You put your arm around me for the first time
If you said youd rather love than fight
Drop everything now
Do you say
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room
Tangled like the roots on the ground
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delight
Hey you call me up again just to break me like a promise
Here you are now calling me up but I dont know what to say
And I can care less that your famous
Everybody loves that mandolin
Shes standing in her bedroom
That face of an angel
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
And every day is like a battle
Tryna get to the phone
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Youre the magicians assistant in their dreams
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
The first date Man I didnt kiss him when I should have
You made a really deep cut
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
Im in the room its a typical Tuesday night
At least then I would know
And she thinks Im psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things
Ooh hanging with my baby
Think I know its with me
The guy who broke up with me on the phone
Ive been spending the last eight months
I almost do
My missionaries in a foreign field
A ring
The more I fight it just gets stronger
So Imma stay through it all
For a while I thought that I could hold you
There wasnt much love to lose
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
Its how you get the girl girl
And now youve come undone and I I I I
I wonder
Little taste of Heaven
That watch him as hes walking home
I may see
Remind me how it used to be
Man you gotta love her
Tshirt blue jean mood ring
And i know that if i turn around you wont be there
And I threw the remote at you
Ill keep writing songs about youI bet you lie awake at night
This is the last straw
And Ive been hoping every day
Just like the two of us
But dont make her drop you off around the block
Broke your heart Ill put it back together
Youre still an innocent
Its flawless
If you have children some day
I almost do
I miss your tanned skin your sweet smile
Firefly you drew me to you
Lets talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate haters gonna hate
Walls of insincerity
But its killing me to see you go after all this time
I want you back but its coming down to nothing
So I question everything I do
I dont dream about the way
If you want a bumpy ride
I got a lump in my throat because
Just take me home yeah
And i hope it never falls
When he said forever and always
And its 2am and Im cursing your name
Lets talk about blood and sweat and tears
Do you mean
Its even kind of cute
I say Just fine
You see another planet
Come back be here come back be here
Now we got problems
Am I ready for the joy am I ready for the pain
Take this chance Ill make you mine
Dont you ever grow up just stay this little
With my hair undone
All that I know is
All I know is a simple name
Upon pillars of salt pillars of sand
His lifetime
I was so sure of everything we thought wed always have
Dont forget dont forget where Ill be
But girl I got the remedy most important in chemistry
I cant take my eyes off of you
And it gets kinda weird
And baby now we got bad blood
The smiles the flowers everything is gone
All that I know is
Someday when you leave me
Saying Its gonna be alright
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
I had to listen to my mummas I told you so
I bet youre thinking of me too
If you live like that you live with ghosts ghosts
Angels fly in the air tonight
Screaming Im in love with you
Dont wait or say a single vow
Both me and my baby
Never an honest word
You made a really deep cut
Cause baby I could build a castle
I dont hate you but I hate to critique overrate you
And if youre wondering if I might
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
Hang up give up for the life of us we cant get back
Face to face and finally
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Its like you forgot the words you whispered to me
And i dont wanna lose your face
Hey
Had gone all wrong
The way you look the way you laugh
I was barely breathing
How we dont have a song
Painted red and he said
And when youre fifteen dont forget to look before you fall
Did you sell me out for a fool
Then whyd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
And I feel like I could
And what can you do that I cant
Oohooh
Its a love story baby just say Yes
Im only asking this because I think that
Id say the chances of that are getting slim
I bet these memories
Burn toast Sunday
What a piece
Mama makes her cookies and daddys just
Your name has echoed through my mind
But I understand it somehow
Oh Im just a girlYou have a way of coming easily to me
Oh yeah mandolin
I always get it
Oh think of me
Again
The way you look the way you laugh
Dont you worry your pretty little mind
And didnt she pray too
Laughed in the dark
Hey all you had to do was stay
Were dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Stay
And it was like slow motion
And Im not perfect you could say
Straight to the top yo
Keep your eyeyes open
So come on come along with me
Ooh ooh I love you I love you
And even though you want to just try to never grow up
It was the best night never would forget how he moved
Why you gotta be so
When Im mad at all the lovebirds
Everything I need is right here by my side
Disappear when you come back
And stars collide in the air so light
Drop everything now
She should keep in mind
She almost called him on the night that he wrote
Look at all this wasted time
And thats how it works
But Im not gonna talk about that
She thinks about it as she talks her talk
And the hours pass by
But Id give anything to have you here today
Take away the pain
And the first thing that youll read is
And not remember what time erased
Welcome to New YorkNice to meet you where you been
Youre still an innocent
You said forever and always yeahIm five years old
Apartment floors
You showed up just in time
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Coz im not scared
Watch him run across to Angelina
That people change their minds
Girl youve got to make it
Make it last all night
Cause I loved you from the very first day
You this was what you wanted
Try and stay out of everybodys way
I I I I I I wish I wish
Stay hey now you say you want it
But the writings on the wall
Having myself another same old browneyed bar
Because the last time you saw me
As my eyes went wild
Its a thug story tell me can you handle that
Ill make one
Were singing in the car getting lost Upstate
I see you turn off your phone
And that was the moment I knew
And you stood there in front of me
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
When i was 12 years old a small town raised
Heartbreakers gonna break break break break break
My heart has never felt this way before
Seems like Im becoming part of your past
Your name forever the name on my lips
On the mattress whoa
Be good to yourself and be good to each other
When I looked like a mess
Peace love
But Ive got a blank space baby
Maybe Ive been going back too much lately
We found wonderland
Youre a bad idea
This girl is begging wait for me
It feels like one of those nights
When tears are streaming down your face
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
If youre moving on
You aint worth all that ten dollars and a six packIm a laid back
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I dont need you now
Said I think I am finally clean
Every lesson forms a new scar
And its this time of year
And I will fall in love again
Its hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
You are an expert at Sorry
My love
In wonderland
I think I am finally clean
Just to please you shes got Bette Davis eyes
And I hope you know that every time I dont
And I see your face in every crowd
You and I got lost in it got lost in it
Your eyes whispered Have we met
When Im mad at all the lovebirds
And an old napkin
And we were dancing dancing
Our song is the way you laugh
Im sorry mmm
And all youre ever gonna be is mean yeah
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Was it everything you wanted to find
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
Bye bye baby
But someone said
And it rains when youre gone
We cant be together right now
Dont count the days as they leave you
He never talked about being scared over the phone
Nearly killed me the day
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Really weird
He looks around the room
A stranger in an all night diner
We are the Kings and the Queens
I read his words out loud
And everybody knows that
Now Im gonna have to listen to my mummas I told you so
So I can save them for a rainy day
I should be able to handle this
Maybe I was just jealous that hed come between me and Britney
This aint Hollywood this is a small town
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
All I know can you show me what you do
And you can want who you want
I wanna talk about what you are that I aint
You were the prom queen I was on this stage
But you got here early and you stand and wave
Oh baby smile
Just like I always wanted but Im so sorry
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
Im so in love that I acted insane
With a note saying I love you I meant it
Store windows traveled for miles
The life of the party youre showing off again
Youve got a busy day today
Come running headlong into my arms
To catch me nowYoure on the phone with your girlfriend
Just know Im right here hopin
Like a scared little boy
You say you love em and baby without you
Do you believe in miracles
I want you back but its coming down to nothing
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
This year to save me from tears
So I think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay stay stay
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
And they said Speak now
Its something we all try to ignore
That cant help but shine through
And bring on all the pretenders
But like the trees we cut our names in
This love left a permanent mark
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
cause Im not trying to show maturity
And buy a oneway ticket on a west bound train
But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind
And we were dancing dancing
You say youre fine I know you better than that
To be played by your dark twisted games
Come on come on dont leave me like this
We hang back its all in the timing
To see me like that
In my mind
I cant stop thinking about you
And I wish you knew that Ill never forget you as long as I live
Flew me to places Id never been
And if you asked me if I love him
Today was a fairytale
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
The best soy latte that you ever had  and meEverybodys waiting
I thinkI think when its all over
Do you mean what you say
If I had known what Id known now
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there
Ive been an angel all year santa baby
Didnt it all seem new and exciting
As I was leaving too soon
It must have been the way you kissed me
just listen to the crickets sing
Cant you see
Theres gotta be moreIm dreaming of a white Christmas
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Who you wanted me to be
No proof one touch
Cause we never go out of style
Im fine just a bit of a mess
But this is me swallowing my pride
Then it makes you turn right back around
Grabs onto her daddys hand
Fall back on you
Guess nobody told you
And ill bet you thought youd beat me
I looked into your eyes
As the sweet
Cause this song is all about Ellen
Cause baby now we got bad blood hey
Makes your head spin round but
Could end in burning flames or paradise
When you come back down
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
Baby were the new romantics
Kiss me try to fix it could you just try to listen
And even though you want to please try to never grow up
Really something
Ive left it all behind me
The highlight of my day
So you see me everyday
So they could shut her out
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could of died
Wind dances
I cant wait for the day I stop pretending
You keep his shirt
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
He is in love
Take me home where we met so many years before
I seen it all
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Did you sell me out for a fool
Your little eyelids flutter cause youre dreaming
Oh and it troubles me so
We ooh getting back together
Lets walk away
Oh yeah yeah
But in case you havent heard the news
Cus Im too tired at night for all these games
2 AM here we are
And make my way into this breezy night
And Ill never never be the same
Got his problems bills to pay
Id give everything to be your anything
The secrets or my deepest fears
But they make it so tough
Please back up oh back up
Wont finish what you started
Theres a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
Baby Ill fall back on you
Someday when you leave me
But by the way
But the whole time Im wishing he was you instead
Everybodys watching
Everybodys waiting for you to break down
Dont need to get intimatejust yet
So I can see
Cause baby now we got bad blood
And I used to say Never say never
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
I dont have a plan I dont have a map
And all youre ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so
Its like a million little stars
I think I am finally clean
And Im a house of cards
And it was a long time coming
Lets talk about what you want to be and who Ive always been
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
Say that you wanna be with me too
Its the same thing to me
Staying back and watching me shine
But I know all his favorite songs
Whatever happened to the things you gave away
Until I see you again
Oh my my my my
Lightning and thunder
Today was a fairytale
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Still throught
He keeps his word
Ill never get to hold
Makes you wanna run and hide
This hope is treacherous
Pretends he doesnt know that hes the reason why
And I dont even know why
youre better off without him
And I I I like it
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
But it would be wrong to
Im getting by with a broken heart you left me with
But I know I saw a light in you
So they follow me down the hall
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
That love had to be so blind
But if this was a movie youd be here by now
The sun would always chase the day
Watching all my life go by
Come on baby with me were gonna fly away from here
Say youll remember me
So shame on me now
Now Im searching the room for an empty seat
Back from the edge of time
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Dont you block me out tonight
Could you tell me what more do I need
He whispers songs into my window
Did you forget everything
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
Now in this perfect weather
Whats the use of wondering why
Stupid boy
And couldnt take it any longer
Ooh just wanna stay right here
You werent brought up that way
But you werent even worth all that ten dollars and a six pack
Everybody saying
Whats the use of wondering whyI need you now
Im feeling like I dont know you
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
Cause everything I want is miles away
And I had space to run
Who love you like you do
I cant wait for the day I stop pretending
But sophistication isnt what you wear or who you know
Just like all those times before
I wish the sky had your face
This slope is treacherous
Theres aint nothing bout you there aint nothing bout you
I would wait forever and ever ever and ever
Unless you play it good and right
And I confess babe
Your guard is up and I know why
You keep seeing double
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Keep your eyes open
Ill be waiting all thats left to do is run
Cause all I know is we said Hello
You take my hand and drag me head first
You pack a suitcase take a picture from the wall
Only you can tell
About the friendly music of a guy
And when I fell hard you took a step back
It really blows me away
Everybody knows that
And I dont know what kinda ropes
But here I am
Theres one guy shes shy
Waking from this dream
Oh and they come unstuck
When I went looking for a reason I know
The moments getting nearer
Just one more thing to do
I cross my heart and hope for you tonightHe said I got me a nice new apartment
They can talk forever they just dont know better
And time stands still when youre nowhere bound
Shes got her magic
I could be your favorite blue jeans
I never talked about the nights he called
And my blind optimism to blame
He caught me staring at him
But heres something you should know that is for sure
And now you say
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
Cause the players gonna play play play play play
I will say I knew it all along
Like were made of starlight starlight
And Goodbyes so much harder
Far enough away
People couldnt believe what Id become
On the
You wish you had stayed
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Across the room your silhouette
So take a look what youve done
It could burn out
Shake it off I shake it off
Miracle
Im only up when youre not down
And I love the riddles that you speak
Everybody knows that
We didnt take that interstate
Oh yeah
And your eyes look like coming home
Breathless
But I remember how it was back then
Are we out of the woods
And it aint you oh
Yesterday was lonely
You can take the girl away from
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
How I gave up on love so foolishly
I never talked about the tears I cried
To stand back where you stood
You have pointed out my flaws again
And all you have is to walk away
So many things that you wish I knew
As I comb back through my memory
And dont rip my heart out
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away
Trying to see through the rain coming down
So take a look what youve done
Saying Does he know
Thats the closest to a cowboy
And let me know what you find
And thats how it works
Did you not write it down
Oh Im holding my breath
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
When you think Tim McGraw
Get back to me get back to me
Well heres something you can try
This love is glowing in the dark
La la la la la la la
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye
Silence this train runs off its tracks
You are in love true love
All my friends are saying
I told myself Dont get attached
Its probably better off this way
In the middle of the parking lot
And i hope i never lose that feeling
Hes so tall and handsome as hell
And youll never see sing me to sleep
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my
Feels like Im falling and I am lost in your eyes
There are people you just come back to
And the seven dwarfs
And dont you leave cause I know
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
Like Oh my what a marvelous tune
If you dont know what you want nothings ever enough
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
Just for you to go again
I bet this time of night youre still up
So heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives
I could dance to this beat
In your wildest dreams ahhaOh oh oh
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
I guess what you wrote on a paper
At Angelinas family bar and grill
Im spinning around Im spinning around
So shame on me now
La La La La
Cause Im gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
One thing leads into another
No proof not much
All alone or so it seemed
We had a beautiful magic love there
22 oohooh
That Im really ok when Im not
Heartbreakers gonna break break break break break
I I I shake it off I shake it off
You and I got lost in it
When you think happiness
We tried in vain
Written on the back of my hand
She should keep in mind
Trying to get my heels back under my headI used to rule the world
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
Breathless
And unfamiliar exit signs
You fight and you talk
And when you find everything you looked for
Baby you hold the key
There are no accidents in what we doWish I had concentrated
And I thought it was a star
Come back be hereDont look at me
Been here all along
Tangled up with you all night
And I know theres a God because I met him
Baby Ill fall back on you
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Wont let nobody hurt you
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
Cause baby now we got bad blood
Or were you left in the corner
And never really had a chance
Hung my head as I lost the war and the sky turned black like a perfect storm
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
And couldnt take it any longer
Lets hear the applause
But I kinda know that I wont get far
You think youre all alone in this place
You aint never been through that
All the things that we wished they would always do
But I have to
I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me
Was I out of line
When your face faded from view
We tried in vain
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you
That he cant disguise
Cause with a face like that baby
Thats her daddys name
Way too long
And you tell me about your dreams
Its so romantic
Get a look on the inside
It didnt go the way you planed
Cause thats where you belong
But I think that its best if we both stay
Dont you think I was too young
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
And Im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me yeah
Ill be one of the many saying
New York be here
And i had you
You never know if time will tell
And me falling for it screaming that Im right
Said Its really been a while
I would wait forever and ever
Tearing up a good July
Take me home
I think youre crazy cause I still love you baby
Baby I know places we wont be found
Come back be here come back be here
So Im gonna paint the town with him
And it just keeps falling
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
Hey Stephen
Every move you make everything you say is right
Just a little outta reach
You made a really deep cut
She should be here now
So take a look what youve done
Back up baby back up
And I never knew I could feel that much
And I hope you dont save some other girl
Oh what you get is what you see
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
Welcome to New York
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
This lifesweeter than fiction
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
And Diamonds on my mic
out of style
Up and down the staircase
Did you feel it
Instead of just invisible
And shell tease you shell unease you
But I have to
Your eyes are dancing
I laugh and I play and I wasnt gonna stray
When its me and you and the same damn games
But I have to
We play dumb but we know exactly what were doing
Myself
And whispered in your ear
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
Wonderin which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
I cant put this down
I wish i could close my eyes and see you
Shell let you take her home it whets her appetite
That I can withstand
When were on the phone and he talks real slow
Down came the rain
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
And every time you shine Ill shine for you
Crazy and a little rough
Take away the pain
Ill leave my window open
Lets talk about what you do that I cant
But they cant take whats ours
Is more than a reaction to your touch
Baby all I want is you
Either way she didnt tell anyone about her first ray of sun
You and I got lost in it
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
I think he can see through everything but my heart
And I know everything about you
This place is too crowded
Ive got an i heart question mark
Id rather hear the truth
Did some things you cant speak of
Memories like photographs
They put her momma in the ground
You shouldve known
From everything we had
So bright
I wish that I could touch
I had so many dreams
Ill be here today and here tomorrow
You gotta come on come on
This revolution the time will come
And youll add my name to your long list of traitors who dont understand
It wasnt different was it
Waiting for the words
Time slows down
I almost do
What would happen if God never let it snow
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Hey
OhThis is really happening
You need to hear me out
And i know
But I dont believe you baby
Go save the world Ill be around
Unbelievable
But they are where mine belong and
And Ill write your name
Youve got a girl at home
I wish you would
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
I could give you fifty reasons
Ooh lifes so sweet right here
Did you forget everything
And youll will find out
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
You belong with me
Of your fears and your ghosts
Not his price to pay
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
Are we in the clear yet
So watch me strike a match
You say sorry just for show hey
One day we will be rememberedElevator buttons and morning air
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
Shes finally well enough to travel
We fall in love til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Now that Im clean Im never gonna risk it
Just one more thing to do
I wish you knew that Ill never forget you as long as I live
He stands there then walks away
Welcome distraction welcome distraction
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
And they tell you that youre lucky
On the steering wheel
Im gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
When all those shadows almost killed your light
It was the best night never would forget how he moved
The water filled my lungs I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
Honey I was trying so hard
Theres no you and i
Ive been on this show
But something I passed really caught my eye
This is the last straw
I love your attitude your rose tattoo your every thought
So Imma stay through it all
But Im too tired to fight
Shake it off I shake it off
You know it used to be mad love
I get what I want
Counting down the ways to see you
Ignoring words that you were saying
Standing in a nice dress
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
For us to finally win
Suddenly life seems just like a new dawn
Hey Hold on hold on
And I dont think we can solve them think we can solve them
To write on his heart in
Oh thats what I learned from you
Boys only want love if its torture
I hope your life lead you back to my door
Tomorrow is still an unknown
Or where else to go
Theyll tell you Im insane
Who feels the way I do
Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
With the sun shining bright
And thats the way I loved you
Makes you feel so empty inside
And dont you leave cause I know
But it gets five million hits on youtube
Youll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world
But Im not gonna mention him
And now youre asking me to listen
We know what we dont have to say
When theres something really wrong
And it was like slow motion
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
I was there when you said forever and always
Burning it down
She wasnt brought up that way
I tried to catch you but I cant
And I am not your typical princess
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
I hope your life lead you back to my front door
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
Its a love story baby just say Yes
Youve got a girl at home
Sees him through the mirror
La la la ha ha ha
Honey life is just a classroom
This thing is breaking down we almost never speak
It was the end of a decade
You call me lucky cause I lose everything
Youre really gonna be someone
Im going back to Nashville
Like were made of starlight starlight
And I broke down crying was she worth this mess
Yeah I show you my new shoes
The moonlight was fallin
Well it was kind of cold that night
Where I lost control
With you today
Oh I thought youd be here by now whoa
Our song is the way he laughs
After you held me is that just what you do
The bitter sting of what we couldve been
No I dont fear no more better yet respect aint quite sincere no more
But there were Christmases when I didnt wonder how you are tonight
Now its too late for you and your white horse to come around
Theres no you and i
Another time and place
Am I ready for the boy am I ready for this game
Wish I could make it better
Oh daddy can I go with you
This here guitar
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me talk to me
Next to mine
Hes so bad but he does it so well
Jealousy misery gonna give you what you gave to me
Mama makes her cookies and daddys just
I never talked about the tears I cried
Til you put me down oh
Got a car got a scar
We could be a beautiful
We were walking down a oneway street
Like were made of starlight starlight
That sunset gleamin
And everybody believed in you
If i close my eyes will you be there
In wonderland
You dont want to fight me
Went in on casino
Into my arms
When he plays a song it brings along
I walk to school and I wear a cross
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water
Lost your balance on a tightrope
And I go back to December all the time
Yeah yeah
Its raining on Sunday
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And my dear you get better
This time Im flying free
I wasnt brought up that way
When did I stop caring
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
I I I I I I wish I wish
I see you found somebody new
And the sparks fly
Hes got his heart on his sleeve
The wind blew by
And thats the way I loved you
Shepherds quake at the sight
22 oohooh
Havent you heard what becomes of curious minds
You touch me once and its really something
I know it will be a sweet memory
4 AM the second day
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through
Lights are off hes taking off his coat hmm yeah
Flew me to places Id never been
On all my wasted time
So hurry down the chimney tonight yeah
Missing him was dark grey all alone
And all I see is someone I dont know
Its sweeter yeah
And all my walls stood tall painted blue
Got em up to there
I I I I I I wish I wish
This is my musical monologue
And youre talking to me
Cant believe the time you lost me
Round and round and dragging down
And all I see is someone I dont know
You looked me in the eye
Its scary how things change
And every time youre here
Dont count the days as they leave you
And the songs we played and the indian days
The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet
There is nothing I do better than revenge
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
Chase the wind
When it was good baby
Cause Im gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
Before you Id only dated selfindulgent takers
If you check off my Christmas list
Look now  the sky is gold
Follow you around
Maybe Im just a girl on a mission
And you can tell me that youre sorry
And hes long gone when hes next to me
All youre missing how
See the lights see the party the ball gowns
The crowds in stands went wild
Now Im gonna have to listen to my mummas I told you so
You never let me drive
And everybody knows that
Emilys home late again
All I know is you held the door
Sweet sweet superstar superstarIn the heat of the fight I walked away
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Girl that boy is trouble
Whats the use of wondering why
Waited on a wire
To hold on to each other
And last Christmas
By the way
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
It jumps through your shirt
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
And dont know how my friends
Somehow get the best of me
Just one more thing to do
So what have you got that I aint
Say that you wanna be with me too
Were happy free confused and lonely in the best way
Shes like Oh my god but Im just gonna shake
looking for the love
Will it be filled with hope and desire
And took the earliest flight
I find myself at your door
Just as long as youre mine
Im sorryI took a chance I took a shot
If youre gonna if youre gonna stay
It doesnt even need a frame
In the pouring rain
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
Would break this kinda fall so baby
And well sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah
You take my hand and drag me head first
The sunlight was falling
A rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
Because baby suddenly were already through
If you into it
Who you wanted me to be
I dont think you do
Meant just for you
Someday you wont remember
I shake it off I shake it off
We are never getting back together Like ever
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
Picked me up late one night out the window
Im sick and tired of your reasons
You look like bad news
Nice to meet you can I teach you
This here guitar
Oh and they come unstuck
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume
Another name goes up in lights like diamonds in the sky
And maybe get some sleep tonight
Theyll tell you Im insane
The one we danced to all night long
And youre feeling like flying
It was enchanting to meet you
But not another minute
Of the fact that shes different
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
I hope these songs will remind me
I think youre crazy cause I still love you baby
The way you kiss The way you cry
All my friends are saying
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
See you make your way through the crowd
Your smile my ghost I fell to my knees
Hey all you had to do was stay
Maybe this is wishful thinking
To be messed with
I walk with my head down
But I have to
Make you feel so BAD
Talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
Come back come back come back to me like
Even though Im not the only one
That heaven is overrated
Hes been overseas
If you love like that blood runs cold
Your hands are tough
But I know you wish it was me
You cant see she doesnt
Your smile and the way you say my name
Make you many friends
Im driving away and I I guess you could say
So its gonna be forever
No reasons why
Im lovestruck and looking out the window
Oh I hate those voices
But you werent even worth all that ten dollars and a six pack
Did you have to do this I was thinking that you could be trusted
Wont you come back to me
So I can scream
Itll be a year today
You go I hope you think of me
And I dont think we can solve them
And he calls exactly when he says he will
We almost never speak
Watch us go round and round each time
Please take me dancing and
Maybe Im a fast train
And we were dancing dancing
Out of focus eye to eye
That I drive you crazy
And they say little girls have big dreams
If I was a stupid girl
Oohooh yeeeeeah hey
Just close enough to touch
And just as I reach out to touch you
But Ill leave my window open
and people would say Theyre the lucky ones
Anytime you want me to
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
Ooh lifes so sweet right here
Your mum and daddys walls
But no one notices until its too
Tell them how the crowds went wild
I say Can you believe it
And I got my heart broken
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
That the towers up in flames
Waiting for her love to find her
To put his kids to sleep
I wake up I stretch out
Your name has echoed through my mind
Theres pretty girls on every corner
The wind is blowing and were both not making a sound
Its gonna take it a while to love again
But it doesnt
Oh but if it dont
Guess it didnt given off rain
She got up again
And shes been living on the highest shelf
I I used to fly
Were here to die for our God
Talk to yourself talk to the tears
When youre the one who lit it
Girls and girls
All you got all you got are your shattered hopes
In dark blue Tennessee
I I I shake it off I shake it off
Dont you wonder why
What have you seen
When I let too much go
Well you drive me crazy half the time
When time stood still and I had you
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate cause were going down
Back up baby back up
I remember your little laugh
Coming down to nothing
Fresh from your war
Like I did before
I I I I I I wish I wish you wouldCause baby now we got bad blood
And I am not your typical princess
And its taken me this long
Heart break is the national anthem
I was trying to fly
This slope is treacherous
For you and me someday
You make the sweetest sight at the window
There is nothing I do better than revenge
I had a lot about you and i
Ill still look at you like the stars that shine
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hang on every word you say yay
And I dont think we can solve them
Your smile and the way you say my name
When you come back down
If I hadnt once been just like herWalking through a crowd
You can hear it in the silence silence
If thats what you need
Id lie
Wait until he sees her
But I dont care cause right now youre mine
We tried in vain
Just what you want
Youre gonna believe them
He says God I didnt bring her up
So Ive been holding on
REVENGE My list of things to do this week
You might have him but I always get the last word
Maybe Im a fast train
So turn that car around
Oh its too late
Well maybe its me
Lets talk about your childhood days
And I remember thinkin
Chasing fortune and fame
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Im dreaming of a white Christmas
Now we got problems
From going out with all of your best friends
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
Im tryin so hard not to get caught up now
Whenever she walks by
and if you ever leave Ill be crawling back for more
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you
You smile that beautiful smile and
No matter what you do
He walks like summer and talks like rain
So youre the only thing on my mind
Hey hey hey
wahooahoo
Tell me did you fall for a shooting star
Because these things will change
I love you
So here I am in my new apartment
Too weak to run
And it took some time but I understand it now
I will say I knew it all along
So many things that I wish you knew
Every time you smile I smile
Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
So shame on me now
When you think Tim McGraw
But we were in screaming color
I dont wanna lose your face
Trying to make up your sweet mind
But all you are is mean
The time we stood with our shaking hands
After everything I must confess I need youTheres somethin bout the way
I know it will be a sweet memory
And want me back again
But ooh this time Im telling you Im telling you
Gonna sail the ocean gonna spread my wings
That starting over would look so good on you
But I cant help wondering why
Took a wrong turn and we
You found me you found me you found me
Tryin to figure out what is and isnt true
But you run away
I watch superman fly away
Uh uh
I guess its too late
A smile on your face a knife in your hand
In this moment now capture it remember it
To my face
Shes upset shes going off about something that you said
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
And if you ever change your mind
Am I ready for the boy am I ready for love
But Im not gonna say that
Now we got problems
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Fearless
I couldnt ask for anything better
She says Please dont make me go back there again
I cant wait for the day I stop pretending
But for me its just a lonely time
I was waving as you drove away
I I I shake it off I shake it offIts 2 AM in your car
He sees that boy drive away
Ill bet you got your mom another sweater
Then finally she sees them
To fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh
And I could tell you now
And I know you wouldnt have told nobody if I died died for you
So take a look what youve done
She should keep in mind
Shes precocious
Who changed his mind and we both cried
New soundtrack
Its not unbroken anymore
Back to a firstglance feeling on New York Time
And everybody knows that
But you just keep holding on
Hold on and I can see it
So Im working on
Its really weird
Never impressed by me acing your tests
Because I can
But she isnt
They never blind me
Yes I remember what you said last night
How do I get it back the way it was before
Is forget it all and just be with you
Talk to the man with the reasons why
Im fine just a bit of a mess
Little taste of Heaven
Until weve found a town
So dont look now
Not like this
And I dont wanna need you this way
All I know is you held the door
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
Im spinning around Im spinning around
You tried to please everybody
Hoping you would come around
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Ill be one of the many saying
And everything I do I do it just for you
With the sun shining bright
So Ive got some things to say to you ha
Bye bye baby
Flowers pile up in the worst way no one knows what to say
Cause all I know is we said Hello
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Until you come up blue shes got Bette Davis eyes
I I I shake it off I shake it off
The days drag on
All I need is to move on fast
You have knocked me off my feet again
Magic madness heaven sin
Baby were the new romantics
But I keep cruising
And life makes love look hard
You can get high on a first kiss
Fearless
Its like no matter what I do
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
With that baby Im right here smile
Stay stay stay
Your shining boots and your full on band
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And Ill look back in regret how I ignored when they said
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
This is the last time Ill drive this way again
Come back be here
And I dont think we can solve em
And she says lucky you lucky you lucky you
But with you I know its no good
And he says
I almost do
But I watched all of it fade
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Taking pictures in my mind
Running free
I left a note on the door with a joke wed made
I had to
Stay stay stay
Are we out of the woods yet
And I never knew I could feel that much
Take it easy baby
In the middle of the night
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
And I waited so frustrated
It feels like one of those nights
Calling me out when Im wounded
I want you forever and ever
Is still burned in the back of your mind
I just wanna know you know you know you
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
For you and me someday
And sometimes we dont say a thing
Now baby dont you break my heart
But not another minute
Baby I know places we wont be found
This is the last time Im asking you why
But ooh this time Im telling you Im telling you
I knew I had to go back home
Hey hey what do you say
And theres a drawer of my things at your place
I know you cant see me here
I want you for worse or for better
Crossing all my fingers
You can tell me when its over
I got a lump in my throat because
Hold on do you believe it
Ill catch you
Got nothing in my brain
Keep your aim locked
There was something wrong it was all my fault
That he found heaven on earth
Dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
They are the hunters we are the foxes
You know it used to be mad love
I cant take my eyes off of you
need metell me
Lady running down to the riptide
Not even that is enough
Im taking pictures in my mind
Theres so much more
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Ask anyone
Strange look on his face
I wish that I could touch
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Nothings shatterproof
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I was believing in you
Its something thats so close but still so far out of reach
Why the hell dont you need me like I need you
So shame on me now
Find yourself another
Stay hey now you say you want it
Oh my my my my
Thinking bout the whole thing
So take a look what youve done
Oh yeah
So shame on me now
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now
Somewhere back inside a room
So I put on my makeup
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
And you flashback to
Youll always need me
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
Not knowing it will be a long time going
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
Aint it funny rumors fly
Thats when you came in wearing a football helmet and said Okay lets talk
May these memories break our fall
Thats what youve been telling my friends
Dont you look now
Never let nobody see him cry
Be there never gonna leave you
Were you ever here at all
And youve got your demons and darling they all look like me
Heartbeat steady
Oh la la
Where I stand and say
This is when the feeling sinks in
I can still see you this aint the best view
I know that we could work it out somehow
Well take this way too far
But Ive got a blank space baby
If you asked me if I love him
Good girl gone bad too much for a Kennedy
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Ill be sick inside if baby you be my cure
You put your coat around me
Oh oh I love you I love you
I live my whole damn life
But you had to talk about why
In my dreams youre touching my face
The playful conversation starts
Somehow that boy finds a way
I think I am finally clean
Make up fresh on her face
I used to roll the dice
Ask anyone
Gonna climb that mountain gonna do everythingOh
And back to the conversation
He says look up
Youre my one and only friend
What have you seen
Im lying here in invisible arms
So may your days be merry and bright
Ooh ooh I really really want you
Just thought you should know
Someday Ill be living in a big ole city
Thats the closest to a cowboy
What do you say
Absentmindedly makin me want you
But heres what youve got
It feels like one of those nights
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Theyll tell you Im insane
I can make all the tables turn
Just think while youve been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty dirty cheats of the world
Sneakin out late tapping on your window
La La La La
When you come back downIm walking fast through the traffic lights
Im looking through your
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
Flew me to places Id never been
Ill fight their doubt and give you faith
Its just me and my baby
Constellations
Just like the mark you knew you were making
I dont think so oh oh oh
Left a small town never looked back
Not knowing itd be a long time going
This slope is treacherous
Wrote you a song you shouldve known
So please dont take that away
Theres not a day I dont miss those rude interruptions
But I think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay
Come back Ill be with you someday
Im a walking tape recorder of everything you say
Im sick and tired of your reasons
And later on that night under the neon city lights
And life makes love look hard
Cause baby I could build a castle
And everybody knows that
Hes got a onehand feel
There are people who you come back to
But she isnt
And I said Oh my what a marvelous tune
You made a really deep cut
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Without you coming up
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
And I feel like I could
Wont you come back to me
Bandaids dont fix bullet holes
I could show you incredible things
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me
To forget why I needed to
A thousand songs
Tell myself I must be crazy
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
Youll be alright
My days once revolved around you
Oh
Wearing your clothes
Take the towel out of my hair
A hundred thousand times
Son of God
Every one of us has messed up too
Shake it off I shake it off
In permanent marker
Broke your heart Ill put it back together together
Oh yeah all right
Now I dont know what to be without you around
Wearing your clothes
Theyll tell you Im insane
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
I wake up Im alive
As I say hopelessly
And everything feels better
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
But you held your pride like you shouldve held me
You know it used to be mad love
And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
And the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake
Walked by and took my heart with you
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Eh
On the drivers side
Im standin on your street
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar
Cant go back Im haunted
But you dont have to call anymore
Everybody knows that
You just see right through me
Everything is wrong
And really long brown hair
You had to fight to have the upper hand
And your eyes look like coming home
In the sand
This is a state of grace
I just gotta I just gotta know
I wont tell nobody
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for meAll the other kids with the pumped up kicks
I guess you didnt care and I guess I liked that
He never wanted people to remember his name
And then you say
Sorry for the inconvenience I didnt mean to let you down
Meet me in the pouring rain
And even the moment I knew
Made Up YouHes got a nice little life
Of driftwood
Has ever looked this good to me
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
Its not the kind of ending you wanna see now
But thats not true cause I know you
And I knew when I saw your face Id be
So shame on me now
Somewhere else
You kiss on sidewalks
This is a big world that was a small town
the other half Im only trying to let you know that what I feel is true
And baby now we got bad blood
I thought there for a little while
And I know its long gone
And Im not perfect you could say
I said Leave but baby all I want is you
Sweep the streets I used to own
She should be here now
Hey
I was expecting some dramatic turnaway
I dont know about you
Youre all I want but its not enough this time
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
So dont think its in the past these kinda wounds they last and they last
I dont know about you I dont know about you
And I stare at the phone
But youre untouchable
Looking so innocent
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Oh red
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
Spelling out your name
Complicated got away by some mistake and now
Misty morning comes again and I cant
And I wish I could run to you
Oh yeah
There is a video
When he plays a song it brings along
Tell me
A little pathway headed for the skies
The whole place was dressed to the nines
But hell never find them all
When you come back down
This lifesweeter than fiction fiction
And I will get you and get you alone
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
I was gonna be everything you need
Ooh ooh come a little closer
Lets talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Now we got problems
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
Even when youre sleeping
Fond gestures are exchanged
Right here right now I feel it on my skin
This is the worthwhile fight
I watch you talk you didnt notice
Chasing his way through the constellation hey hey
All that I know is
And I count the colors in his eyes
When he said forever and always
Oh yeah
Whos that guy who plays the mandolin
Somebody blows your candle out
You are in love true love
Wont see you again
To the diary of me
And didnt they call you
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
Hey Stephen
I want to be everything you need
And thats how it works
Come on come on dont leave me like this
You can crash and burn and now Im someone new
The haze
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
And by the way
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Hold on never turn back
And I hope you know that every time I dont
In the middle of the night
And you flashback to
I remember waking up with you
You know it used to be mad love
I wish I could keep you firefly
Can you feel this magic in the air
And youre tied together with a smile
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
Forever going with the flow
Yeah We were were happy
When everythings gonna go just right
You ended it
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And you can tell me that youre sorry
Oh baby dont persuade me
Youre not sorry no no oh
I wanna feel you by my side
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Over you for real
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
Id lieShe didnt have a reason to go oh no
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
So good to me so right
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Hope its nice where you are
This year to save me from tears
I see you found somebody new
Im like 8 foot 4
Just when our love was like a burning flame
22 oohooh yeah yeah
Youll still wonder
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
Red light turns to green
Drop everything now
Like we dream impossible dreams
You dont have to call anymore
Right here right now I feel it on my skin
Youre better off youre better off without him
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
Count them as you find a day new
Its just another day
Where nothing ever happens
There youll stand next to me
Dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
Stars collide in the air so light
You cant see I love you
I have always been a bit reckless
Cause its not fair that youre not around
Ill be your everything tonight
It takes five seconds to need you
Raided and now cornered
That Im really ok when Im not
But it made us turn right back around
Oh daddy can I go with youI drive around this town
But well stand up champions tonight
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Of the fact that shes different
Cause Id rather be alone than lose you
Today was a fairytale
Ill be your angel giving up her wings
And my old faded blue jeans
Would the song still survive without five golden rings
But were faster and never scared
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyre not talking a week or two
Spinning me around
You can see it with the lights out lights out
This slope is treacherous
Youve got a girl at home
I I I I I I wish I wish
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Laughing at a bad break
Do you still feel like you know what youre doing
I hope you think my favorite song
Its a roller coaster kinda rush
But not this time around
I wanna tell you why
All I know is we said Hello
Like were made of starlight starlight
And never makes me wait
Head back to the Milky Way
Knock on wood and rope the moon
When theres nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
You understand perfectly
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Once youre gone I know your memoryll
To see my little girls smile
So wheres that crown gotten you these days
And I said
Oh yeah
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
So shame on me now
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
I always get it
Then back to red again
But Im not gonna talk about that
Whoa
This year to save me from tears
I used to be a damsel in distress
Your kiss my cheek I watched you leave
But here I am in the same old car
You wouldnt be shattered on the floor now
I still miss you
And what do you do when the one
And I said she was crazy
Come on come on oh oh
In permanent marker
But how can I put out this fire
Shes not a saint
Baby I know places we wont be found
Thats the closest youll see me
Til you put me down oh
Well it couldve been easy
So dont you worry your pretty little mind
He opens up my door and I get into his car
Didnt you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
I watch superman fly away
Saying wasnt it just like swimmin out on the lake
Its okay life is a tough crowd
Cause each time you reach out theres no reply
Guess theres no use in trying
Faster than my bullet
10 months sober I must admit
Stumbled through the long goodbye
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
I cant help myselfSay youre sorry
You had it figured out since you were in school
Forever more
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
There was nothing that was out of reach
Whistle County creek
I had high top Nikes
What if happiness came in a cardboard box
After you held me is that just what you do
Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
And may all your Christmases be whiteI like the way you sound in the morning
All I see is you looking at me
We were standing in an empty room
Baby you showed me what living is for
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
If you say it with your hands
But I liked it better when you were on my side
Cause that one moment when your breathless and your hoping
Oh daddy can I go with you
Hes got his mothers eyes his fathers ambition
Firefly
There aint nothing bout you there aint nothing bout you
Wondering if youll ever find
I dont always have to be alone
All the time
Ill be waiting all thats left to do is run
And I wait around that old wishing well
And when you find everything you looked for
Its my turn to be meOn a crowded highway
Back now that its just too late
Maybe well stop talking and Ill haunt you like a ghost
You might be expecting me to say
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
Follow you around
To be under my skin wrapped around my heart
Or its gonna go down in flames
Seen you lost in a crowd seen your colors fade
Its a new soundtrack
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Everything will be alright alright
But every night with us is like a dream
And i dont wanna turn around
And Id say
It feels like one of those nights
Well I get so confused and frustrated
But Im feeling 22
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Dont try me
But I dont wanna have to go that far
Time turns flames to embers
And you do what you want cause Im not what you wanted
Youre the last thing I needed tonight
Lonely like a harbor line
You dont know about me
I never thought wed have a last kiss
All I need is on the other side of the door
Santa baby I want a yacht and really thats not a lot
and Im not crazy and
Standing in a nice dress
Welcome to New York
But theres nothing more to say
And I cant breathe without you
Waking from this dream
You would you would if this was a movie
And I never never saw you coming
And we were dancing dancing
And I will get you and get you alone
And you gotta live with the bad blood now
He still hasnt called
Diamonds in my mouth
Say a single vow
Even when I was wrong
Flew me to places Id never been
Id rather do
You couldve been getting down to this sick beat
Heavenly hosts sing halleluia
Lets talk about blood and sweat and tears
Emily opens her eyesI had to catch my breath
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
Now I deserve a little bit more than
And I mustve been crazy to let you get away
But they never blind me me
Lady running down to the riptide
Youre better off youre better off
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
The phone rings on a rainy night
But youll come back each time you leave
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart
And we caught onto something
Everybody saying
But you were just a temporary high
I bet these memories
Please dont be in love with someone else
I hear Jerusalem bells aringing
This pain you thought would last forever and ever
We hadnt seen each other in a month
Ive watched from a distance as you made life your own
Loves got me tangled tired me too
Or just play you til you came undone
Oh hes the kind of guy
We sing it proudly
Cause loving him was red
His hands are in my hair his clothes are in my room
All I know you can show me what you do
If a broken heart
Its a new soundtrack
Its all fun and games til somebody loses their mind
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heartLast Christmas I gave you my heart
People throw rocks at things that shine
Never imagined wed end like this
Red lips so hard to miss
Breathless
Cause youre everything to me
You give me everything and nothing
And not remember what time erased
It was a moment of weakness and you said Yes
I know people change and these things happen
And yet shes the same
Just like the mark you knew you were making
And youll say
Youre an exit sign
Cause youre my lullaby
And I Ive got you down
Be my mirror my sword and shield
And if you come around saying sorry to me
Cant call it love if you aint in it
And you cant see me wantin you the way you want her
And thats the way I loved you oh oh
Youre not sorry no no oh
And I know you heard about me
And mean and mean and mean and mean
The stakes are high the waters rough
Next chapter
But I have to
I was crawling home
Look what youve done
What do you say
And its not theirs to speculate
I was there when you said forever and always
Flew me to places Id never been
I live my whole damn life
Standing there in my party dress
Shes got her diary to show
You couldve helped if you had wanted to
Like everyone hes got a few but
Oh oh
Whydo you have to put down my dreams
And lookin back on all of that its nice to believe
I had it all what a shame what a fall now
Dream big aim small
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
I hear the sound of my own voice
And thats what these tears are for
Dont wanna hurt anymore
Fix my heart put on my makeup
Hes gonna live it but on
And you love the game
you and I are paintin pictures in the sky
Please leave me stranded
Bend all my rules
Living off of bar tips trying for relationships
Wait right by the phone every night
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
Cried into my bed
Didnt he call you
Keep thinking maybe I
So fall back on me
At least youll know
All you had to do was stay
Are we out of the woods yet
Ill just move on
I go back to December all the time
Dream about
Welcome to New York
Ooh ooh we could get married
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
Dont look at me
Merry Christmas everybody
But you are not the kind of boy
But you saw enough
Maybe shell sing you do do do do
An i heart question mark yeah
Were on the phone and without a warning
I just wanna know you know you know you
Ooh ooh I love you I love you
I see you turn off your phone
And dont you leave cause I know
Uh oh
To get knocked off our feet
To you everythings funny you got nothing to regret
But you were everything to me
Cause Ive been on the verge of
Cause there we are again on that little town street
Who means the most to you
La la la la la la
By the way
I would give it all up to be
Winds of change blew you away from me
I know you hate my friends so tonight I called em all
Everybody knows that
Oh my God who is she
I love you to the moon and back
Little left of the middle
Praying the floor wont fall through again
Got a long list of exlovers
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
Like were made of starlight starlight
Wasnt really in your heart
Never imagined wed end like this
I dont need you now
See the train is coming for me
So why cant you see
Shes got her hopes up
Im sorry mmm
I had it all what a shame what a fall now
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Oh a simple complication
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
And all Ive seen since eighteen hours ago
Took our broken hearts
You are in love true love
They never saw it coming
There wasnt much love to lose
I never miss a beat
We wont be sleeping
Next the doors were closed on me
And thats what I learned from you
When I loved you so I shouldve known
Why you gotta be so meanI used to think one day wed tell the story of us
Did you have to ruin what was shiny Now its all rusted
All this time how could you not know baby
That dont do something for me
Youre better off youre better off
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
Wasnt it you that told me
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Makes me run for cover when youre around
Oh Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Till I do
It was a moment of weakness and you said Yes
Talks business with my father
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
In the sky oh my my myI was riding shotgun
Missing him was dark grey all alone
But you know you only get one
I walk to you
Dont need the real thing
I knew you were trouble when you walked in you were right there you were right there
That girl in the song had it so good
The songs he plays just living free
Im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like
Til we run out of road in this one horse town
Im laughing cause I hope hes wrong
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Maybe Im a storm front
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
Please dont be in love with someone else
Singing songs youve got memorized
Really weird
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
And hes long gone when hes next to me
Staying up playing back myself leavin
Hes staring out the window and puts her picture down saying
It must have been the way
My mommas in the kitchen worrying about me
Please dont have somebody waiting on youNow go stand in the corner and think about what you did
I found from back when I was three
Its a love story baby just say Yes
and
Oh who you are is not what youve been
She was an American girl
Buy a oneway ticket on a west bound train
But your close friends always seem to know
the greatest living hero that ever was
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
He still hasnt called
And you know its all the same
The beat of your heart
There was nothing left to say when it all came down
But it didnt
Now Im standing alone in a crowded room and were not speaking
Come now running headlong
I love you when youre singing that song and
I have to go cause he dont know
BreathlessEmily comes home from school
You belong with me
Or the girl living next door
And you just might find who youre supposed to be
Can you imagine no first dance freeze dried romance fivehour phone conversation
Into my arms
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there
Holy infant so tender and mild
So this is me swallowing my pride
Make it last all night
Just close your eyes
Dont you
All at once the rest is history
Cause Im not your princess this aint a fairytale
The war outside our door keeps raging on
I dont dream about you cause I dont need you now
Youve got a girl at home
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
I think I am finally clean
We small talk work and the weather
You never let me drive
Meet me in the pouring rain
Turn the page its all the rage
And I know theres a God because I met him
Baby even a lie
You and I
What What I knit sweaters yo
I watch superman fly away
Everyday
Straight to the top
Let me love you kiss you
Cause baby now we got bad blood
I like the way I cant keep my focus
This cowboys running from himself
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Fall back on you
Sneakin out late tapping on your window
Always end up dancingI wake up I stretch out
Turned on that radio
We need love but all we want is danger
So dust off your highest hopes
Cause I dont think you do Oh
Crazy and a little rough
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Well its been a year it doesnt surprise me
Im dancing on my own dancing on my own
We used to watch the sun go down
Saying wasnt it just like swimmin out on the lake
22 oohooh yeah yeah yeah
To be messed with
I wish I could keep you firefly
All you had to do was stay
And I roll my eyes and then
Smiled
Welcome to New York
And if you asked me if I love him
Loves a fragile little flame it could burn out
Its not my fault I just couldnt see
Its been waiting for you
Shes never gonna love you like I want to
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet
Guess you gotta run sometimes
As we go through the rain
That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
I run and run
We never go out of style
Like a million little stars spelling out your name
Oh who you are is not what youve been
But thats ok
People ask me how Ive been
Playing soldiers
Coffee at midnight
This love is good this love is bad
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
Youve got a smile that takes me to another planet
Oh yeah all right
I had
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
I mean it I mean it
And Ill scream out the window
But it wasnt
Wondering what to wear
And I waited so frustrated
Blowing through a valley
Do you know when you go
Thinking bout the whole thing
You and me
Than love and lie
I wish that pretty girls wouldnt see you
Its the kinda ending you dont really wanna see
Shes got her hopes up
Love is a ruthless game
Trouble trouble trouble
Really weird
Well I guess I wished on a plane
What do you sayShes looking in the mirror
He stood up and said Thats funny
Cant turn back now Im haunted
But loving him was red
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
I said Thats a lieState the obvious I didnt get my perfect fantasy
Youd run around
Wake up and smell the breakup
Hey what you doing with a girl like that
Dont you dream impossible thingsTook a deep breath in the mirror
But keep in mind
It must have been the way
I didnt say half the things I wanted to
I wasnt brought up that wayI like the way you wanted me
With no one to impress
Your necklace hanging from my neck
Now you knowAll this time I was wasting
I say I heard oh that youve been out and about with some other girl some other girl
I was captivated
We drawn the line cross it out turn the page
And I know I hurt you
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I said Yo yup
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
Another name goes up in lights You wonder if youll make it out alive
Like shadows in a faded light
Say youll remember me
Are we out of the woods
I wish you would I wish you would
Stay beautiful
Another mess i didnt plan
Round yon virgin mother and child
And force us into a goodbye
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apartnow
Running scared I was there I remember it all too well
Well maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
For the things that she does
If youre out there
Stealing other peoples toys
The small town lights
I havent crushed this hard in quite a whileoh damn
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad mad mad
Ive left it all behind me
Says Its officer Tate
I looked into your eyes
Why you gotta be so mean
All I need is on the other side of the door
A thousand miles
I just wanna open your eyes
The night we couldnt quite forget
She dont even know you
Twothirty AM
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
And dont hate me for loving you
Youve seen the world now all you see is me
Say youll remember me
You with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
I want you for worse or for better
You felt enough
Dont you make cry tonight
Breathe without you
You can see it with the lights out lights out
Or the south of France
All you had to do was stay
Im afraid that he might think of me as plain ol Jane
Oh oh
The girl in the dress
Im not much for dancing
To tell me everything is fine
I wish you would
You better run
Bandaids dont fix bullet holes
Hey how have you been
I think that the worst part of it all wasnt losing him
I would wait forever and ever
Were not talking about a week or two
You cant get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah
With no one to impress
Welcome to New York
Cause Im a singer turned rapper
The rumors are terrible and cruel
Am I ready for the bliss am I ready for loveAmerican boy living life as it goes
Shell expose you when she snows you
I just wanna make sure
Ill give it to someone special
I shake it off I shake it off
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
So you dont have to call anymore
I wish you would come back
We never go out of style
I I I shake it off I shake it off
But I swear Id be careful with it
And how he ran up on the stage
Sixteen blue jeans Abercrombie Tshirt
Honey I was trying so hard
Soon shes gonna find
And may all your Christmases be white
That could light up this whole town
In my monologue
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Wondering love how Ill feel today
If its wrong and
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Always end up dancing
Well I guess I wished on a plane
Fall back on me baby
And theres a letter left on your doorstep
Even when youre sleeping sleeping
All that I could think to say was
I hope you think of me
I know it will be a sweet memory
Cause they dont play our song
I was enchanted to meet you
We should be together
You cant feel nothing at all
Think Im finally clean
And Ill do anything to see it through
Left yourself in your warpath
So he drives down to
Tell me baby
You got the keys to me
Theres nothing on TV
I just wanna feel okay again
The girl in the dress
I never talked about the nights he called
Wasnt it beautiful runnin wild til you fell asleep
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
Mind over matter thats what she says
You called me later
Dont say I didnt say I didnt warn ya
Dont you dream impossible things
In a city wouldnt you have hated that
You say that you cant live without me
Dont you ever grow up just stay this little
But dont ruin yourself I aint your competition
Standing next to me
I wonder if you know
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me Why you gotta be so
This revolution the time will come
Oh youll never go again
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
I want you back but its coming down to nothing
Like ever
Flew me to places Id never been
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Thats when I could finally breathe
Baby you hold the key
Cant talk to my friends
My heart my mind and number have changed
You shouldve said No you shouldve gone home
It rains when youre here
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
It takes five seconds to need you
And I say
22 oohooh
Take time to realize I know
Thats how it works
Would break down and cry
Summers over and leaves begin to fall
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
South of France to Reno
And I wanted to know how that would feel
Baby I didnt say my vows
I like baking and things that smell like winter
I hope you think my favorite song
And Ill go sit on the floor
Come on gather round Im gonna tell you how the fire went outTheres a little girl in this little town
She took him faster than you could say sabotageI guess you really did it this time
Mandolin
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
I was talking crazy
Got a long list of exlovers
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on
Will my first love be true and real
Stolen kisses pretty lies
Baby let me love you
That Im really ok cause Im not
They might be bigger
Ive played
I cant help it if you look like an angel
I just wanna know you know you know you
Am I ready for the boy am I ready for love
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Oh
I had time to think it all over
No nothing in the world will ever once destroy
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
In the clear yet
You ask me for my love then you push me around
You make the sweetest sight at the window
Cried the whole way home I shouldve known
And we pretended it could last forever last forever
About that time you call me
But I cant confess
Long live the walls we crashed through
Sweet sensations and anticipations
I I I I I I wish I wish
Everyday he says darling youre my best girl
This love is glowing in the dark
Is it like anywhere youve been
Tonight well stand get off our knees
Hard to breathe nobody knows its you
Oh who you are is not where youve been
And Ive been holding on
Jealousy misery gonna give you what you gave to me
Oh oh oh
He tells a joke I fake a smile
Like any real love
Everyday now theyre talking war
And the people that we meet
And this little old town just hasnt been the same since
Come on come along with me
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
Must have been somewhere between
Light up when you smile
In dark blue TennesseeShe walks to school with her arms crossed
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore
Oh but if it dont
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
If you gave me a ring
Im feeling like Ive missed you all this time oh oh oh
Come running headlong into my arms
Was there some reason Im not aware of
Is follow you
You can feel it on the way home way home
Move it or shake it
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
I dont need you dont need you now
Yeah
The moment I saw you
But I dont believe you baby
Dreaming about you
Find out what you want
Ooh yeah ooh yeah ooh yeah
Say it but I wont
The whole place was dressed to the nines
This here guitarBeneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Id be fine if you just walked by
Id like to know just where to go
Standing there in my party dress
But this love is ours
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Sure had a good time
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
Today was a fairytale
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
He cant see the smile Im faking
Youve got a girl at home
Baby what happened please tell me
I wish you would
Even when youre sleeping sleeping
Its a roller coaster kinda rush
To talk walk think stop
Everything will be alright
Oh but if it dont
Youve got a busy day today
For me to try to tame
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Dear John I see it all now that youre gone
Oh never grow up just never grow upThere I was again tonight
If you live like that you live with ghosts hey
To do whats upstanding and right
Made Up You
And the cynics were outraged
His sisters beautiful he has his fathers eyes
Ohoh ohoh oh
There youll stand ten feet tall
All I really wanna say is I need you babe
And meet me there tonight
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And its safe and warm
I thought youd want to know
So Ill watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
Floating through the air
But how could you understand
You gotta come on come on
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
The tide chase
They say its better to have lost than never to have loved at all
You might have him but havent you heard
Something I cant get out of my Head
The past through
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And Im wearing my heart on my sleeve
Baby baby REVENGE
I dont even know if Ill know when Im there
Now POV of you and me similar Iraq
Oh
Since his return from the stay on the moon
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane
Oh its so sad to
With a beautiful boy
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Keep on melting me with those eyes
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Keep your eyes open
I was enchanted to meet you
Dear John I see it all now it was wrong
We had the perfect love story
Dont know if I could
If you keep me next to you
I grabbed a pen
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
Either onell be alright
As long as they dont touch
Oh daddy can I go with you
But can you tell me now youre the lucky one oh oh oh
I would have stayed up and Made Up You
The windows opened up
And six running horses under my hood
Im sick and tired of your attitude
Its my turn to be me
But I do I do
Loves a game wanna play
I love you when youre singing that song and
We learn to live with the pain
A few years had gone and come around
I would have stayed up and Made Up You
Should have fit like a ring
I guess what you wrote on a paper
Today was a fairytale
Thats what people say mmmmmm
Hi Taylor
Got lost in your eyes
It feels just like a day
One without a permanent scar
So shame on me now
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Long long live the walls we crashed through
Even if its just pretend
And you got your share of secrets
Caught you staring every other girl down
This path is reckless
I know you by heart
At least then I would know
I know places
Find yourself another
Im poetry complicated
Yes I could tell you his favorite colors green
I got a lump in my throat because
Angels fly in the air tonight
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Who took all of their problems out on me
Dont you look nowWe used to walk along the street
But that was when I ruled the world
She was always so much braver than me
Back when we had all night
In the sky the pretty lights
Or with a nasty scar
It takes everything in me not to call you
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
I guess some people come around and purpose she
Let me remind
Guess were on the same flight
Yeah oh oh
We are never ever ever getting back together
HeyHe said Lets get out of this town
The way you kiss The way you cry
So polished that it slips right through your hands
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
You find yourself at my door
And it aint you
Cus Im too tired at night to call your name
Knock on wood and rope the moon
A song that sounds like a death march
I wear sneakers
Say its been a long 6 months
Wont let no one break your heart
but baby I was betting on you
And you made me believe
Think I know where you belong
Dont wait or say a single vow
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Its a roller coaster kinda rush
I wish you would I wish you would
You meant more to me then than you ever knew
Eye to eyeHere in my mind the sky looks the same
Was there some reason Im not aware of
Cant turn back now Im haunted
And I dont wanna get there too soon
Losing him was blue like Id never known
But all I want is to have you back
I wish that pretty girls couldnt see you
And baby now we got bad blood
Whoa oh I need you baby
That Im the one
I could dance to this beat beat
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I like to think Id be all that you wanted
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with youLong handwritten note deep in your pocket
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
Ohoh
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
I know the passwords to your emails everything you do
Beautiful beautiful beautiful
And there you are on your knees
Cause baby now weve got bad blood hey
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
You shouldve said No baby and you might still have me
He checks out Mozart while he does taebo
Baby what happened please tell me
And bring on all the pretenders
There youll stand ten feet tall
In wonderland
And you dont know it do you
Burning red
I may see
And the saddest fear comes creeping in
There is something I can do
Though I wanna find
I hope you cry getting my REVENGE
Hold onto this lullaby
thats grown up american boy
I might fall in love
Nothing lasts forever but this is gonna take me down
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
Help but wish I could see your face
But moving on from him is impossible
Into my arms
Oh oh
Hundred mile an hour lives
Its how you get the girl girl
Back roads was a better way
Never ever thought Id see it break
Ive been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
Was that blood or a wine stain
And theyre all laughing
Welcome to New York
Cause baby now we got bad blood
Stare right into my eyes
I love each freckle on your face oh
Breathe without you
Now did you think it all through All these things will catch up to you
I was believing in you
Yesterday I found out about you
A million little shining stars had just aligned
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
You can see it with the lights out
Whenever youre around
For some reason I cant explain
Wish Id never grown up
In the front seat of his car
Forever the name on my lips
I bet you got pushed around
And I said
I guess you didnt care and I guess I liked that
Theres nothing
Tell her how you must have lost your mind uhuh
And in this perfect weather
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night
So jump then fall
Didnt you flash your green eyes at me
Come on baby with me were gonna fly away from here
The midnight moon was blazing baby I was gazing into your eyes
Was it just like the promises that we made
Cause this is where it goes
Lets talk about what you do that I cant
But baby dont you break my heart slow
Im not afraid
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
I could still be little
The way you love with all you have
You can see it with the lights out lights out
And i dont wanna wake one day
As if I dont already see them
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Ive found that time can heal most anything
And whispers turned to talking
Can you imagine no love pride deepfried chicken
Youre in love
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
Its a warm May beautiful day
Everybody here was someone else
And every day is like a battle
And everybody knows that
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin againYou shouldve been there
To move the furniture so we could dance
She didnt have a reason to stay
Of you in that green dress
Tried to tape it back together
Ive never been anywhere cold as youI didnt know what I would find
Music starts playin like the end of a sad movie
So its gonna be forever
Youve got a girl at home
Burning it was red
Just two kids you and I
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
The stakes are high the waters rough
Even If I could
Its miserable and magical
Id say the chances of that are getting slim
Break you make you sorry
Eh eh
Long live all the mountains we moved
And the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake
That never gets told
Youre really gonna be someone
She felt so out of touch cos she just felt too much
Welcome to New York
Dont ask how but fate decides
Its a warm May beautiful day
I dont wanna live without you
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
I I I shake it off I shake it off
And I lied I swore that everything was fine
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Let me tell you now youre the lucky one
Christmas must be something more
It must have been the way you kissed me
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Crazy and a little rough
hearing daddy maybe Ill be like you
Smokey black nights
Whoa oh Im feeling you baby
I just get down yeah
These simple words on his goodbye note
Welcome to New York
Cause everyone we know is trying
I keep waiting for you but you never come
It was my baby anyone could see
I dont know why all the trees change in the fall
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
Is yesterday we were just children
Hey isnt this easy
Guess nobody told you
So Ill just get my coat
But Ill bet you want to
And now youve got me alone
Well rock our babies on that very front porch
Ill be here today and here tomorrow
And I go back to December
Stand there like a ghost shaking from the rain rain
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
Can you tell me now youre the lucky one oh oh oh
Of the fact that shes different
We were supposed to be forever but its too bad you didnt see that to me
Talk to you forever
What did you need from me
I guess youre in London today
I just wanna show you
If you love like that blood runs cold
And I just wanna tell you
And then you feel so low
To get to where you are
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
But Im not gonna say that
It must have been the way
And when you take you take the very best of me
I need you now
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Cause baby now we got bad blood
I do remember the swing of your step
I I I shake it off I shake it off
Just walk away no use defending words that you will never say
When I still see it all in my head
Youre my guitar
We tell stories and you dont know why
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight
Ellen works a long day
I remember you dancing before bed time
Now we got problems
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
I should say hey by the way
Thinking bout everything weve been through
This girl is begging wait for me
When you say our love could last forever
Youll see meId never gone with the wind
Baby were the new romantics
Wondering if you were ever coming around
X is the shape I drew through your face
And I dont think it ever crossed his mind
Youre a distant memory
Oh Im holding my breath
Going back to Nashville
Honey shell love you funny how some view
You smile that beautiful smile and
And make you realize
Would never be the same
I guess youre in New York today
Cause you still dont know what I never said
Hey yeah whats the word on you
So jump then fall
Is aint your territory
If the high was worth the pain
Oh oh
To be messed with
To write on his heart in
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Everybody said that you were bad news
I slammed the door
Nice to meet you can I teach you
Ill run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
In the palm of its hand
She wasnt brought up that way
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
And moved on
And the conversation with the little white lies
Dont fade away
All you had to do was stay
This is the last time Im asking you
Whenever youre around
Never knew I could feel that much
And no one will desert you
Ive seen
Well take this way too far
You spin me around
We got nothing figured out
What I wanted its true
And I know theres a God because I met him
It was the best night never would forget how he moved
Welcome to New York
I wish Id never grown up
Dont count the days as they leave you
Wasnt really from your heart
Youre still all over me like a winestained dress I cant wear anymore
Wait the worst is yet to come oh no
Til she got her fame and fortune
Didnt they need you bad enough
Make it last all night
Theres this movie that I think youll like
Move out find out
Its been waiting for you
Just dreaming about
We go walking down the river all together
All my friends are saying
I want you for worse or for better for worse or for better
Howd we end up this way
For me and Britney
I wish you would
Words I heard you whisper to me
With every Christmas card I write
Driving home by the river side
The waters high youre jumping into it
Well Im only me when Im with you
Firefly
Ohh oh oh
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
They never thought theyd see the day
You never did you never did
Welcome to New York
Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey well just disappear
and if you ever need love Ill be standing at your door
Christ the savior is born
So it goes
This mad mad love makes you come running
Cried the whole way home
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Yes yes I can see it now see it now see it nowThe way you move is like a fullon rainstorm
People throw rocks at things that shine
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I cant help thinking this is how it ought to be
I wish you knew that Ill never forget you as long as I live
Ive been waiting for you
He smiles its like the radio
You found me you found me you found me
Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do
Did you sell me out for a fool
Its 2am and Im cursing your name
Oh cause its not his price to pay
Uh uh
You didnt see it coming or did you
Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through
I couldve put em to good use
I dont wanna hide anymore
So sorry dont worry
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
And Im still not over you
But you start to talk about the movies that your family
Talking bout your daddys farm
Who I wanna be
Why you gotta be so mean
Youre in love
Cant stop thinking about you and I
Itll leave you breathless
Your eyeswider than distance
I guess heard you wrong
Later on you can expect some prank phone calls baby
Follow you follow you home
Its something we all try to ignore
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
All the boys think shes a spy shes got Bette Davis eyes
And I hope the sun shines
But every night with us is like a dream
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
If I hadnt once been just like her
Tearing up a good July
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
And well tell each other things like I need you
Oh yeah
In dark blue Tennessee
And your shoulders brush
Romeo save me theyre trying to tell me how to feel
When you were putting up the lights this year
Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa oh oh ohhh
I always forget to tell you I love you I loved you from the very first day
Wanna see you pick up your phone
Sparks blowing off that cute face and that shy smileoh man
Cause baby now we got bad blood
You say that youd take it all back given one chance
Reminds me that theres time to change hey hey
You know it used to be mad love
All I can think to do
Youve got a busy day today
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
I need you now
Cause baby I could build a castle
I love you when youre singing that song and
She came along got him alone and lets hear the applause
People there cant help but care
And youre dancing round your room when the night ends
I found that picture
And make fun of our exes uh uh uh uh
She said I wish there was some way
To roll your eyes at honey
Burning brighter than the sun
I wont pick up the phone
Baby burnDrew looks at me I fake a smile so he wont see
And love will find you one way or another
The jurys out but my choice is you
We are too busy dancing
Until Brad Pitt comes along
Every little piece love
We found wonderland
Why are people always leaving
Or with a nasty scar
Tell me
Boys only want love if its torture
Ill be your angel giving up her wings
That you would walk away
Cold barn struck bed everything you said
You think everybody wants a fight
I might miss you bad but
Wasnt it easier in your fireflycatchin days
Waiting there for you but you never came
I fall right into you
In the summer shade
And yet shes the same
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
But I know I had the best day
Can you imagine no first dance freeze dried romance fivehour phone conversation
I I I I I I I I I
And you dont know how nice that is
I dont need you dont need you now
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Will my love come in a bowl of fire
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
My names Heather
Stay hey now you say you want it
Christmas must be something more
Before you go tell me this
Lightning and thunder
Its black and white youre smiling down at me
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet
Oh I dont wanna grow up wish Id never grown up
Youre gonna sing the words wrong
Id rather hear the truth
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up
Youre better off youre better off without him
All I had to do was make up my mind
You belong with meI see your face in my mind as I drive away
Oh oh
wherever you think I am tonight
Lets put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
I think you fell out of the sky today
I have always been a bit reckless
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
Oh oh Im caught up in you
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
A long time going
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
Down the aisle three men walked and said
The lingering question kept me up
I remind myself you were meant to fly
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
And shes not what you think
I wrote your name down
And when youre close I feel like coming undone
She doesnt have too much to say
Oh dont fade away baby
Running free
Its time
It drives you crazy
And thats the way I loved you
Say that well be together
They werent true
I have always been a bit reckless
You guys bleeped me and I didnt even say anything
Come on come on
The other on my heart
And that was the moment I knew
But Im feeling 22
My daddys gonna show you how sorry youll be
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back
Race cars on the kitchen floor plastic dinosaurs
Be there never gonna leave you
Hope youll feed with the crumbs she throws you
But the sweet breeze swept you away
You were wrong and i was right
So dim that spotlight tell me things like
Cause I honestly believed in you
You put your arm around me for the first time
Come morning light
Its like a million little stars
Welcome to New York
Should have all worked out
And dont you know
The front porch steps
Laughing at a bad break
Like any great love it keeps you
And when weve had our very last kiss
Everybody else was everything to you
And we run
Id have never guessed
For me and my baby
I see it all now that youre gone
Realized I loved you in the fall
Maybe this year
Everybody knows that
All you had to do was stay
Cause were young and were reckless
Dont forget dont forget about me
Wishing I could slow down time
Hes the song in the car I keep singing dont know why I do
Wasnt it easier in your lunchbox days
But I never planned on you changing your mind
Couldve sworn you said you loved me
The endYour little hands wrapped around my finger
Well Id rather you be mean
Like we had our own secret club
And I was too cloudy
And it was like slow motion
And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
Yes yes this is what I thought about
A rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite
Think of my head on your chest
Talking about love and how it changes things
But I take it all back now
But for you I did
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing theres no right answer
Past the pumpkin patch
Be that girl for a month
Dont know how long its gonna take to feel okay
The way you talk the way you tease
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
I just wanna I just wanna know
But when the sun came up I was lookin at you
That Im the one
This love left a permanent mark
Its fearless
You and I got lost in it wonderland
Who you are is not what you did
In permanent marker
The one we danced to all night long
But if God forbid fate should step in
Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Baby you know all the right things to say
Think of my head on your chest
This is the last time Im asking you this
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
Oh who would ever wanna be king
And thats how it works
On my hand
And I said
In my monologue
Cause Id seen the sky
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
All I know can you show me what you do
Now Im pacing down the hall chasing down your street
I dont wanna miss you like this
With nothing to lose
Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
Youre better off
Ive got my big coat on
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
That youll come in with the rain
Looking at it now
Come back come back come back to me like
i want to be somewhere where you are
Im no one special just another
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
To speak to you
You carry me from your car up the stairs
Do you say what you mean
Is My god hes beautiful
And all you have is to walk away
Move to Paris
And youre mortified your moms dropping you off
Id go back to December turn around and make it all right
Uggg so he calls me up and hes like I still love you
Said youd beat me up you were bigger than me
Its not really anything he said or anything he did
The way you move when you walk by
I was in your sights you got me alone
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
Down came the rain
At 14 theres just so much you cant do
To slow my travelling
Youll always need me
The rain didnt soak through my clothes down to my skinStanding on the border
You can hear it in the silence silence
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
You can feel it on the way home way home
Breaking pieces off with every lie
And I am hiding in the curtains
And they said Speak now
Even if its just in your
You were the perfect view of misery
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
No one could touch the way we
And the words i wrote down on a page
I wont tell nobody
I wish you would come back
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream
Shes ferocious
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
The moment we meet there was never a doubt
Left to travels lives they unravel
He says Baby is something wrong
Now he knows to keep it off the wall
But I wont cause
What would happen if presents all went away
And down here from the ground I see who you are
I pass the pictures around
We Were Happy
Keep your eyeyes open
What do you see when you look in his eyes
Or a second chance
I dont let nobody see me wishing he was mine
Im just another thing for you
Dont you wonder why
Stripped to the bone
cause its late and his mama dont know
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
And they read off our names
With the holes in the knees
I said No one has to know what we do
And all we know
And why Ive spent my whole life trying to put it into words
I talked to your dad  go pick out a white dress
But I have to
Its 2 AM in my room
And it rains in your bedroom
Way too long
One thing leads into another
And right there where we stood was holy ground
It was a wicked and wild wind
I walked out and said Im settin you free
You will find out
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
And thats how it works
Spinning me around
But if you look a little closer
You gotta come on come on
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
I dont feel welcome anymore
Think Im finally cleanFlashing lights and we
Start thinking if you were with anyone but me
What did you need from me
Im looking through your eyes
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
And I go back to December all the time
Baby you were watching me
Baby Ill show you Ill show you
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
Come morning light
It seems like one of those nights
Who do you think you are
You can tell me when its over
All that I can say
Well just drive down this road till the one were on ends
Thats sorta how I feel right now
Its really weird
In a snow covered little town
Youve got a girl at home
Put my name at the top of your list
I know what I want
distracted by he view
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
I wear tshirts
Theres no time for tears
Cause Im gunna see my daddy tonight
Small talk he drives
Keep your eyes open
You cant feel nothing at all
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
I stand up with shaky hands all eyes on me
Nothings shatterproof
Ohhh
But there was one thing missing
And all I wanna do is say
Lady running down to the riptide
Please dont bring me down
Ha
Knowing that Im strong enough to let you go
She couldnt help thinking that there was a little more to life
Had me in the palm of your hand
La la la la la la la
Breathe without you
Im just another thing for you
We sing it proudly
Going back to Nashville
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind
Welcome to New York
You taught me bout your past thinking your future was me
Why the hell dont you love me
My friends and enemies
It wasnt our song it was yours
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Come back be here come back be here
That was as good as our song
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
Since the beginning of the year
Youre in the car on the way to the movies
Youre tied together with a smile
I dont even know her
And I wonder
This is me praying that
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Come back be here come back be here
I dont wanna lose your face
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
Ive got a picture of you in my bedroom
Keep your eyeyes open
and right before your eyes
Just a shot just a shot in the dark oh oh
Back up baby back up
And you say Lets run away now
I watch superman fly away
And we know its never simple never easy
and Im not crazy and
Hes not all bad like his reputation
Say youll see me again
Ive been doing fine without you really
Breakin down and coming undone
And you smile and say How are you
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
Before the monsters caught up to you
Youve got a girl at home
Ooh
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
That Im not a princess this aint a fairy tale
No I never really been in a club
On the boats in the water
Shes an actress whoa
Over you for real
Youre the last thing I needed today
Yeah youve got something they dont
But you dont know what you dont know
If you could see
You can get by with sweet tea and Gods graces
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Tell me
Blue dress angel face
Tell me
In permanent marker
Seasons greetings hope youre well
To talk walk think stop
We are never ever ever getting back together
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
I wont tell my friends
Then whyd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Hell be pulling up soon
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Oh lady running down to the riptide
Broke your heart Ill put it back together
Asking God if he could play it again
Never fade
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Until Brad Pitt comes along
May your days be merry and bright
I learned the dirt roads
So look at you
And through the tears she said I couldnt do that to you
So why the hell dont you love me
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Girl why are you crying
Letting my heart linger
You were the prince
When the night ends
Stay stay stay
Why would you wanna break would you wanna break a
About a beautiful boy who died
Every time the things got rocky yeah
Im gonna miss you bad but
You and I walk a fragile line
Now Im standing alone in a crowded room and were not speaking
I saw the footage from the roof
But you are everything to me
I almost do
You find Im even better than you imagined I would be
You took the time to memorize me
When you say our love could last forever
People throw rocks at things that shine
Before the fight before I locked you out
I just stood there like a ghost
And Ill never never be the same
And I wish you knew that Ill never forget you as long as I live
Since the feeling aint strong
Ill give it to someone special
Cant see where they are
And what do you feel when you know its real
Baby like we stood a chance
If you want
Like I did before
The smokey black nights
That this is really happening
When the porch lights were shining bright
And you dont even know where I start
So dim that spotlight tell me things like
Trying to survive
By now I think you see that
La la la la la la
But right now my time is theirs
We are never ever ever getting back together
And remember what we were fighting for
At least then I would know
Could have been true love
Proved me right proved me right when you proved them wrong
Oh lady running down to the riptide
And put a wreath up on your door
Heres to you and your temper
And I dont appreciate you calling him to reminisce
Jump then fall baby
Mama makes her cookies and daddys just
This slope is treacherous
Who were you and where are you
And life makes love look hard
And theyll be chasing their tails tryin to track us down
Standing next to me
You tell the crowd youre paying dues
And lead me up the staircase
Youre my Achilles heel
Shouldve burst through the door
Yeah yeah red
Something holy not superficial
Meet me in the pouring rain
Remember that shes getting older too
Dont you think I was too young
Repeating history and youre getting sick of it
With you todayAnd its a sad picture
Or were you left in the corner
All those kisses up against your car
But honey most of them are true
Taken away to the dark side
Away
Well it couldve been easy
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Cause I love the gap between your teeth
Make it or break it
That shes been waiting for this all her life
But I fell in love with this here guitar
Once you go there was never
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Lose my number
Stupid girl
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Maybe youll drop what youre doing
I take your photo off the dash
Id tell you I miss you but I dont know how
Fearless
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Bandaids dont fix bullet holes hey
Talk to the man who put you here
Diving off into the deep end
Tell me did you fall for a shooting star
Dont fade away
He tried to teach me from the very start
Say it but I wont
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
Long live the walls we crashed through
And say Hello
Til you put me down oh
Now Im standing still I am disappearing
I cant help but wish you took me with you
But its still soft enough to cry
And everybody knows that
You smile just like a picture
And I remember thinking
Go save the world Ill be around
And ya feel the same way same way
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
Sleep in heavenly peace
When you think Tim McGraw
We showed um all up
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
But I was just a toy which you destroyed
With a little too much heart to go around
I wish I could keep you
It was losing me
Oh oh
But Im about to play my Ace
Or was it just like those promises that you made On our last night
Well on my way
She got up again
Tell them how I hope they shine
She said Im sorry for waking you up but I didnt know who else to call
Youd see that today holds something special
But baby dont you break my heart slow
Ooh ooh dancing with me
These days I havent been sleeping
It wont take too long
Christ the savior is bornWhat if ribbons and bows didnt mean a thing
To sing to you
One step not much
Your smile and the way you say my name
Just like the ones I used to know
Shell never notice how you stop and stare
But Im dressed to kill and tonight Im going out on a date
This is the golden age of something good and right and real
Cause my God died for me
I love it when theyre touching mine
I got a lump in my throat because
It starts with a smile and we walk a few miles
If you live like that you live with ghosts
The way you kiss The way you cry
No one wrote
Will you ever know
Trying to make me stay
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a deadend streetPut your lips close to mine
Dont you know that theres nothing I wouldnt do
I watch superman fly away
the other half Im only trying to let you know that what I feel is true
And you were just gone and gone gone and gone
Hes close to my mother
I dont need you dont need you
I just want it back the way it was before
And Ill take them down take them down and open up the door for you
If the high was worth the pain
Dream about your eyes
Where is this going
We go walking down the river all together
Its been occurring to me Id like to hang out with you for my whole life
Of you and me
Cause I I know places we can hide
Just grab my hand and dont ever drop it
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Didnt they tell us dont rush into things
Just a little outta reach
And unfamiliar exit signs
But the very next day you gave it away
Good morning loneliness comes around when Im not
Stay hey now you say you want it
You make me crazier crazier
Halleluia
He said be true 2 yourself  keep your spirit free
Youll be alright
Who were you before you even knew me
Spinning me around
Cause you were Romeo  I was a scarlet letter
Staring at the sunset babe
Call a cab
Cause its tragedy and itll only bring you down
It just comes back in flashes you know
She stood alone on her balcony
You were callin my name
Dont walk away now
Everybodys waiting for you to break down
Tell meOh
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
Stabbed in the back brimstone fire jumping through
And I watch you fly around the world
You saw me start to believe for the first time
Its okay life is a tough crowd
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
Baby
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
The past through
I hope you cry getting my REVENGE
Something holy not superficial
I said Thats a lie
It must have been the way
With that same big loud opinion
She thinks about it
Fearless
Watched him catch the ball
Its two AM
What if I kept the handmedowns you wont grow into
With some indie record thats much cooler than mine
Then I tear it all to shreds
Oh oh
This is my SNL monologue
Cause you dont feel pretty you just feel used
If you had never come out of the blue
No one can hurt you now
You know it used to be mad love
Jump then fall
I might believe you if I didnt know
Dont wanna come down
Im sick and tired of your attitude
Cause baby now we got bad blood hey
And darling it was good never looking down
Cause they dont know to play our song
Trained to get along
So why the hell dont you love me
But I never thought Id live to see it break
Missing him was dark grey all alone
It must have been the way you kissed me
Its poker he cant see it in my face
Staring at the sunset babe
In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
And I dont know
I used to let you choose
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
Ohoh yeah
But I was there to watch you leave
Windows down you pass my street the memories start
Still live with my parents but Im still a thug
And all we are is skin and bone
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Its so wrong that all I wanna do
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
Cause Im gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
Oh oh oh oh
I wont pick up the phone
So here you are at my window
But they never blind me
Another girl sings about a boy
With the holes in the knees
To talk walk think stop
Eh eh
In your room all alone
And everybody knows that
Cause my heart is yours
Shes better known
It must have been the way
I guess I just lost my balance
You can plan for a change in weather and time
Lets talk about what you wanna be girl and who Ive always beenI cant believe you did it again
This year to save me from tears
Make you many friends
And shes not what you think
You were my best four years
Shell lay you on the throne she got Bette Davis eyes
Cause these things will change
Jump then fall into me
I imagine you are home
Written on the back of my hand
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside
I shake it off I shake it off
I could show you incredible things
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
Did you notice one less pair of hands
Did you forget everything
I like the way you needed me
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
And bring on all the pretenders
Where have you been
Oh Im just a girl
And everybody knows that
TSwift and TPain all up on the same track
And my old faded blue jeans
Where is this going
On back roads at night
Lightning and thunder
One last kiss then catch your flight
All you are is mean
Probably mindless dreaming
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Oh oh I love you I love you
You were mineSanta baby slip a sable under the tree for me
You and I got lost in it
There aint no accidents in what we do
So here you are two steps ahead and staying on guard
And every time you shine Ill shine for you
Whos that guy who plays the mandolin mandolin
And said oh my my my
I wish that pretty girls couldnt see you
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
Couldve sworn you said you loved me
It seems like one of those nights
Oh its so sad to
But its not cause were just sitting here
And talk to someone I dont know
Wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
Oh I dont wanna grow up wish Id never grown up
Finally clean
Or someone with a softer side
And its 2am and Im cursing your name
If you were wondering
And Im not perfect you could say
Everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
I always get it
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
Baby this is what we do
A perfect little dream inside my head
And when youre fifteen
Like waves crashing on the beach
Ooooh Yeah
Til you put me down oh
There are people that you come back too
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
All you had to do was stay
Youre beautiful
And I feel like I could
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you
But youre coming undone oh
Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Yes I remember what you said last night
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
Hes looking right at her
Cause nothings quite like being with my baby
Just sees his face in every space in every room
One thing leads into another
And you were gonna marry me
Drive all night just south of knowing whyI got a lying smile I never put out for you
Keep your eyeyes open
Cause it might be you
Oh yeah
He says hes so in love hes finally got it right
I can see the end as it begins
Can you feel it now
That I want and Im needing everything that we should be
What What Dont test me Beep
You said I do and I did too
It was my season for battle wounds battle scars
I watch superman fly away
La la la la la la la
And every day is like a battle
In case you havent heard
Lets see if you believe in me
You might think Id bring up Joe
Sitting fishing by the river bank
I shake it off I shake it off
So Ive been holding on
It was rare I was there I remember it all too wellIt feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
Spelling out your name
And were not speaking
That dont do something for me
Its the age of princesses and pirate ships
So I punched a hole in the roof
So its gonna be forever
I look around turn the radio down
Breaking down and coming undone
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Are we in the clear yet
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a deadend street
And made blind
You come to my door
So whos gonna hold you
But here I am an open book
Theres a fire inside of you
Lets consider this lesson learned
Were all here the lights and noise are blinding
I was born free
Get a look on the inside
And it started rolling down the street
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time
Time slows down
And I saw
And Im down to my last breath
Please tell me if youve seen one
All I know is that you drove us off the road
That youll stand by me forever
You could write a book on how to ruin someones perfect day
Didnt they tell us dont rush into things
10 months older I wont give in
Im wonderstruck dancing around all alone
It rains when youre here
Whoa oh Im feeling you baby
Youve got a girl at home
Still all my life I got money and power
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Oh whoa whoa whoa
But in my mind I play it back
And look at me
Im dreaming of a white Christmas
That hes the one and you wanna go fast
Blond hair to the floor
Dont need you
You shouldve been here
Ill be the one waiting there even when its cold
Cause baby I could build a castle
It was all a little
Deep youre sinking
Mosaic broken hearts
And baby all I see is you
But its something i just fell into
Blowing through the valley
From the one thing I thought would never leave me yeah yeah
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
Ooh ooh come a little closer
I dont know how to be something you miss
The songs he plays just living free
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I grew up in a pretty house
I wish I could keep you  firefly
Ill write a song
Cause it rains in your bedroom
When I said Ill never let you go
Ive never been on the outsideSeems the only one who doesnt see your beauty
And right there where we stood was holy ground
Hello UghDo you remember the day
The closer that we get
This love is good this love is bad
There was nothing left to do
Please take my hand and
Shes an actress whoa
Come back come back come back to me like
I remember the drive home
Lead her up the stairwell
Shouldnt a light go on
Didnt you flash your green eyes at me
And asking me about you
That I had the best day
So heres to everything
You better run
Never fade
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
You made a really deep cut
Do you know when you go
So I cross my heart and hope for you
and Im not crazy and
Onto the sand
Well now hes back from that soul vacation
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
And how to let go
Someday Ill be living in a big ole city
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
Taken away to the dark side
Loves got me tangled tired me too
Close enough to hope you couldnt see
You say its in the past you drive straight ahead
Put them in a drawer
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know youre wrong
Oh oh I love you I love you
Could you tell me what did I do
Our song is the slamming screen door
Ive watched you so long
And she says that
Now weve got problems
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Lights flash and well run for the fences
Oh oh
I said Ive been there too a few times
Yeah you skipped the conversation when you already know
I do recall now the smell of the rain
I just drive on by just south of knowing why
But I was just a toy which you destroyed
But something bout it felt like home somehow
Her hands are never cold shes got Bette Davis eyes
Hes got his heart on his sleeve
oh sinking ships
I know places
Tonights the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
And I could tell you now but never mindIt wasnt just like a movie
Hold on baby youre losing it
Mmm I cant help myself
It was cracked down the middle permanent scars
Are we out of the woods
After all this time you and I
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
You always knew how to push my buttons
Didnt she need you bad enough
And i dont wanna turn around
And this love came back to me
To a platinum mine santa honey
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
And all your little brothers favorite songs
Than have to say goodbye
Shes pure as New York snow she got Bette Davis eyes
I think I am finally clean
Somehow get the best of me
But Ill bet you want to
You need me now
Is that the day holds something special
If you were here wed laugh about their vacant stares
The bitter sting of what we couldve been
Who were you before you even knew me
Dont you know that Im trying to hate you
I said let them say were crazy you said lets go fishing a lot
Its really weird
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
Swimming in the water tank
Why I shouldnt let you in
And bring on all the pretenders
Its my turn to be me
But all thats dead and gone and passed tonight
I know places I know places
Youre about to lose your girl
Just twin fire signs
Ill follow you follow you home
Now tell em who you are
Oh but somethings different this time
I got tired of waiting
I swear shes destined for the screen
The sun would always chase the day
And we were happy
Remind her how it used to be yeah yeah
Hey all you had to do was stay
Took off faster than a green light Go
Just take me home
And shes not what you think
I make the moves up as I go moves up as I go
And that was the moment I knew
And we know its never simple never easy
And all you have is to walk away
In a Mustang with the top down
But if you kiss me now I know youd fool me again
You belong with me
Im spinning out of control
Going through the photographs staring at the phone
And crawl out the window
Im waiting alone now so come on and come out and pull me near to shine shine shine
We are never ever ever getting back together
Im sure there are so many girls
But Im ready to fly
Ill be sick inside if baby youd be my cure
I thought I had you figured out
Grab your passport and my hand
Oh Im just a girl oh oh
Trying to block you out cause Ill never impress you
On the outside looking in
And I wait around that old wishing well
And thats what they dont know mmmmmm
Been here all along
We get so caught up in all of it
Oh permanent markerI couldve keyed your car
Blue jeans and a little dirt
You cant feel nothing at all
Come on come along with me
Theres nothing
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Dont be afraid please
Come back and tell me why
Wildest dreams ahha ohh
Theres a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
Sitting here singing
So go and tell your friends that Im obsessive and crazy
Breathless
Thats what we thought
Angel devil
But I cant make them stay
Instead of sleeping
The whole place was dressed to the nines
Tell me why
And youve called a hundred times
I want to be where
This time Im flying free
The summer sings a lullaby
And tried to open the door
In wonderlandOne look dark room
But I still mean every word I said to you
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you
When my world wakes up today
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
Welcome to New York
Wondering love how Ill act today
Where I lost control
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
So shame on me now
And by morning gone was any trace of you
And been trampled on
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
And bring on all the pretenders
Happy endings
I almost do
And for the first time I had something to lose
Its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Cause it rains in your bedroom
I need you to need me
Long live the walls we crashed through
Cause baby now we got bad blood
A token of true love
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
Coz im not scared
Well now hes back in the atmosphere
Written on the back of my hand
Only thing that kept me alive
You opened my eyes
He kissed his wife good bye
Shake it off I shake it off
It rains when youre here
Lets talk about what you want to be and who Ive always been
You you know I would die
Wondering what to wear
Hey
Until you find somebody new
I love the cracks the curves the hidden beauty
In backyards winning battles with our wooden swords
I thought was a star
Youre gonna believe them
But they never blind me me
Cause baby now we got bad blood
Will you stay
And well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
Jump then fall into me
Next year I could be just as good
What I mean is
I reached for you but you were gone
Fall back on youSomeone struck a match against the night
These hands had to let it go free
He crept back in her memory
Oh let me down slowly
Feelin like I just lost a friend
Baby somewhere around the time
Ohohohwhoawhoayeaah ohI know he loved you
With your face and the beautiful eyes
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him
Baby you hold the key
And asking me if I wanna try again with you
Lay down your guns
I hear the words but all I can think is
Please tell them my name
X is the shape I drew through your face
Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Forever the name on my lips
Youve got a girl at home
There must be an explanation
You gotta come on come on
Sneakin out late tapping on his window
American boy living in the real world
Smokey black nightsDays go by I wonder if you here me
And when youre home alone at night
Of what love gave me and took away
But at night you live it all again
Oh oh oh oh yeah yeah oh oh
Cause we never gave in
Even though I know youre not there
And now that Im sitting here thinking it through
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Just grab my hand and dont ever drop it
We were talking
Once youre gone I know your memoryll
On the
Hey thats when I realized
Youll never leave me
Somehow you made it through
And it rains when youre gone
I hope you think my favorite song
On the mattress whoa
Back up baby back up
I I I shake it off I shake it off
Somehow it feels like were flying
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
They said love was complicated
You know it used to be mad love
And his voice is a familiar sound
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I want our love to last forever
Did I say something way too honest
Cause nothings quite like being with my baby
I put the magazine down
And you dont know it do you
And i still love you
Only thirteen blocks across this town
Can you feel it now
I havent seen them in a while
Someday youll turn your radio on
Are you so far above me
Outrun my gun
Like we dream impossible dreams
You were lookin at me
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
Its half full and I wont wait here all day
I dont want to jinx my luck
Im holding every breath for you
Talking bout your daddys farm
Tomorrow is still an unknown
Feeling like theres nothing to figure out
And she says lucky you lucky youYour feet under the table
Doesnt he know that Ive had him memorized for so long
She could talk to you all night
I love you when youre singing that song and
He loves to argue oh and it kills me
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
Just like the mark you knew you were making
I dont wonder where you are
I never saw it coming wouldnt have suspected it
That you might not be the golden one
Look at who we could be
Bright lights late nights
For you and me
All the boys think shes a spy shes got Bette Davis eyes
Take time and erase you love dont hear no more
I was playing back a thousand memories baby
And all you do is let me down
If I had a reason or a simple goodbye
I thought there for a little while
So I best be driving slow
For my head on a silver plate
Trouble trouble trouble
Wasnt it beautiful when you believed in everything
But Id rather you be mean
Ive been holding back this feeling
That principles office and says
Cause you know I love the players
Guess you gotta run sometimes
A part of this a part of you
I say Theres nothing you can say to make this right again
Forever more
Tangled up with you all night
And living and learning
Come now running headlong
Your car comes to a rest in the drive
Oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So you deserve some applause cause youre so much better
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
Cause we never go out of style
We are too busy dancing
I know this shouldnt be a lonely time
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Hes funny dark and tall
Welcome to New York
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Cherry lips crystal skies
There aint no accidents in what we do
Youd better keep it to yourself
But I do
If you had never come out of the blue
With a beautiful boy
His strength is making me stronger
By the way
And turn it inside out
So take a look what youve done
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Still believing there might come a day
Have you ever thought just maybe
Oh
In the front seat of his car
Im lost in the sound of it
Can make sense of something crazy
Im wonderstruck dancing around all alone
You open up the door and I see you smileWalking downtown shuffling my feet
But Im not fine at all
Stupid boy
Screaming Im in love with you
That I drive you crazy
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
Youre not gone You cant be gone No
In my monologue
Guessing
What if angels did not pay attention to
Seems like everyones got someone to hold
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Going back to Nashville
La la la
Staring at the sunset babe
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
Why the hell dont you need me like I need you
Crazier crazierIve been counting days and
I wanna talk about what you are that I aint
Youll have new Septembers
I felt your arms twisting around me
We were lying on your couch
Wishing you were at my door
And Ill never never be the same
I say Nothing
Shorty Im a take ya
She sings her little song she walks along
Hes charming and endearing
I thought I knew
Dont look at me
And if she had to die trying
Going back to Nashville
Goodbye baby
Dont you look in my eyes
Its kinda hard to aimI dont think that passenger seat
Man you gotta love her
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
I wont do that to you
And we were happy
You never know if time will tell
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
So you were never a saint
Because I can
You made a really deep cut
You just never know
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Miracle
Floating through the air
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
Im not usually this way
But this love is brave and wild
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
Had to dooo yeah
I find myself something decent to wear
Oh what you get is what you see
So we went on our way
Dont wanna hurt anymore
I always knew this time would come
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
I dont know what else I can say
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
It was a few years later I showed up here
And I wont be alone tonight
So I cross my heart and hope for you
If you live like that you live with ghosts
sometime along the way you take my breath away
They are the hunters we are the foxes
Id go back to December turn around and change my own mind
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
I I I I I I wish I wish
Jump then fall
But would they write a song for you
That you deserve another try
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
Cause Id rather be alone than lose you
And I dont know where you are
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I need you tonight
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
Id rather take a blow
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
I need reasons why youre leaving
Youve got a girl at home
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
There youll stand next to me
But that was something I wished you would say
Hows life Tell me hows your family
And I stare at the phone
But now Ill go sit on the floor
And that was the first day
The sun goes down on a good day
But baby never mind
The rain we thought would last forever and ever
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
When Im in this dream
You paint me a blue sky
And Im on the bleachers
22 oohooh
Even if its just in your just pretend just pretend
Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Before I let them see me
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
They wouldnt teach you that in prep school so its up to me
Will tell you its true
Dont look at me
Tell me what would you find
And when I got home  fore I said amen
This morning I said we should talk about it
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Breathless
the dream of an american boy
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
He still hasnt called
Its beating in my chest
Im lying here in invisible arms
And unfamiliar exit signs
Eh eh
And I know for you its always me
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
I could be your favorite blue jeans
Flew me to places Id never been
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
I hope you cry getting my REVENGE
And talk to someone I dont know
Flew me to places Id never been
Now I know
For some reason I cant explain
Nothing comes true
You know it used to be mad love mad love
You might as well forget my name
You can get by with sweet tea and Gods graces
Cause everythings okay
Mad about him
And its what i put my life into
What I want you to say
Ill be right where you are baby
Thats just another thing
This is really happening
It must have been the way you kissed me
So dont let nobody take that away
Halleluia
I looked up at the sky
Ill give it to someone specialPlease take down the misletoe
And you looked at me got down on one knee
These beats of a dark heart use basslines to replace you
Not such a big loss
Everything is better
SANITY I hope you lose yours tonight
I had a dream last night
You can feel it on the way home way home
And everybodys here except you baby
As I turn out the light
That I cant even see anyone when hes with me
Last December last December
Say that well be together
When youre standing on a mountain
It was good baby
Oh we made quite a mess babe
Youll never leave me
On the
Sang a thousand words
But I dont wanna go there anymore
Ill keep writing songs about you
Cause Every single time I come on this show
In a big city they just dropped me off
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
And we run
So heres to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
Do you remember all the city lights on the water
When you look down and see
It was good baby
Im not afraid
All throughout the day
Can you tell that Im dying
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin
Youll see me
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
You said you never met one girl
Giving weird interviews in a slick cool sweater
And this is really happening
Just a small town boy and girl
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And youll know you didnt beat me
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
I can still feel you hold my hand little man
And your eyes look like coming home
But nothing seems to work the first few times
What a sight what a sight when the light came on
Talk to you forever
But Im not gonna brag about that
Im looking good
Oh oh
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now now now
But Im a little smarter my hearts a little harder
You take my hand and drag me head first
Angels above you aint so far away
On the playground wont
What have you seen
I was just thinking
Why did you have to look so good
If what you are is a daydream
For the things that she does
My friends and enemies
Well it couldve been easy
Saw you just the other day
And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one oh oh oh
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
And all you have is to walk away
And I was right there beside him all summer long
He will try to take away my pain
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Bet mamas wondering where we are
Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
I want to know how it feels to be
But you changed the rules everyday
Ive been spending the last eight months
But just look what ive created
Even though the wheel rolled on
Im counting every dayMy momma stood across the room
And keeping lines blurry
Comes back to me burning red
Now I only want
I know placesThe drought was the very worst
And we drive and drive
Why the hell dont you need me like I need you
Ooh ooh I love you I love you
22 oohooh
And I see it when Im looking at you
Then discovered then discovered
Fall back on you
Well thats good enough for me
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
Burn burn burn baby burn
I wanna feel you by my side
It was good baby
Didnt she call you
This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Hes the time taken up but theres never enough
Truth be told
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Morning his place
Its something we all try to ignore
but for someone like you its just so easy to do
Think of all the fun Ive missed
I think you and I should stay the same
When they point to the pictures
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
Ive been an awful good girl santa baby
Youre still an innocent
You and I
And something reminds you
Were so young but were on the road to ruin
I wasnt that little girl you used to see
Ive heard every album listened to the radio
Dont you see the starlight starlight
Fifteen
So weve been outnumbered
Daddys smart
But do you honestly expect me to believe
Somebody made you cold
And I cant breathe without you
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
Right now Im scared of both of you
Who understands you
One day we will be remembered
On the playground wont
Last time Im asking you
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
And this love came back to me
Girl that boy is trouble
Youre thinking that I hate you now
Some say some say they sell they souls for a couple hits
Running free
Will my love come in a pouring rain
And now that Im sitting here thinking it through
Kinda scared cause
Now we got problems
Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
Theyre dimming the street lights
Innocently overlooks the truth
So heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives
Where were you
She said He tried but theres just some things I wont do
And Im down to my last breath
But in case you havent heard the news
By the way
We showed um all up
Unbelievable
But you pull me in and Im a little more brave
Business and relationships
We found wonderland
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
22 oohooh
Cause they dont know to play our song
When we decided we decided
And all I see is someone I dont know
You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried cried for you
And I need you like a heartbeat
The sun is going down
If you dont own up will yeah
So heres something you should know that is for sure
I said remember this feeling
I wish there were some other travelers out here
And go back and turn it to rain
And thats what I learned from you
Taken away to the dark side
Make you many friends
Now I know what a fool Ive been
Can you see it now
cuz if you ever leave Ill be crawling back for more
Just like the ones I used to know
About a little thing called love
Yeah
And I still cant take my eyes off you
Drive all night
You put your eyes on me
Wishing the card was from you
But baby dont you break my heart slow
And I wish I could run to you
If you and I are a story
Bend all my rules
And heres to you and your temper
Shes never gonna see the light
So why cant you see
So good to hear your laugh
Youd see that today holds something special
Right next to mine
That you cry but you dont tell anyone
Shoes purse hair tied back
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
Our song is the way you laugh
Bye bye baby
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Find yourself another
Cause youre giving it away like its extra change
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Was it just like those promises that you made
Suddenly rise an american beauty
Made you run and hide
Where the world can take her
And you should see her
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run
And couldnt take it any longer
I wish you would come back
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
And buy a oneway ticket on a west bound train
Where have you been
Spelling out your nameOnce upon a time
So here you are at my window
Mmm mmm mmm
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
And youre doing your best to avoid me
This love is good this love is bad
Tell me
Was it worth it
I dont feel welcome anymore
And youve been getting closer and closer
Welcome to New York
Red lips and rosy cheeks
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
You need to hear me out
Or its gonna go down in flames
So dont say Yes run away now
Til you put me down oh
About you and me
But hes taking it slow
And dont wait for the sky to clear
The sun goes down on a good day
In the dead of night your eyes so green
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded
Baby were the new romantics
But loving him was red
I have always been a bit reckless
But I was just a toy which you destroyed
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread
Id go back to December turn around and make it all right
I wasnt brought up that way
The simple things in life are always new
Well I have walked through the fire
He never wanted word to get around
Were a crooked love in a straight line down
You dont know about me you dont know about me
Just let me know
It was the feeling that came along with it
Hanging with my baby my babyHer hair is Harlow gold her lips sweet surprise
No I aint got a gun
Been here all along
And ruined my VMA monologue
Once bitten and twice shied
You belong with me
You used to shine so bright
But you know you got a mean streak
When hes taking my breath away
And you might think im bulletproof but im not
This is looking like a contest
Kaleidoscope of loud
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this
The picture frame is empty
I know that we could work it out somehow
For us to finally win
Youre gonna sing the words wrong
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
In silent screams
Dont you remember You thought that I would need yah
I want to know how it feels to be
He said Look at you worrying too much about things you cant change
And my hearts not breaking
And it rains when youre gone
I really really hate that
All around your feet
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
Think about the good times
All I could see was you and I
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I was there when you said forever and always
When Im with anybody else its so hard to be myself
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
With you
Time moved too fast
The battles in your hands now
And I almost do
But I know I had the best day
And all the times I let you in
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
That boy she went ran off with well I thought he was crazy
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
And think of who we could be
All because of Ellen
As he runs his fingers through his hair
It was the night things changed
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
You and I got lost in it
And all my single friends are jealous
The car pulls up and Im home too late
And not remember what time erased
Guess nobody told you
Im fine just a bit of a mess
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
The battle that we swore
Dont walk away now
So dont you worry your pretty little mind
And then you feel so low
You hit the ground running
Catching stars and fireflies
They never thought youd make it this far
Every single time I come on this show
You chase down the newest thing
Are you with me
I had the time of my life with you
The taxis pulled up on the very day of
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
And let me know that its not all in my mind
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure
Cause the players gonna play play play play play
Trying to have a dream without you in it
Cause baby now we got bad blood
Laying in the green grass I was watching clouds pass
May your days be merry and bright
Lose my number
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Telling me Im not in love anymore
You and me
Or thats what you thought
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Youre gonna sing the words wrong
So babe if you know everything tell me why you couldnt see
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
I can only love you
Ive never been so wrapped up honey
I sat down and cried
Im going back to Nashville
For some reason I cant explain
And you dont know it do you
This aint Hollywood this is a small town
About anything but you
Never thought wed have a last kiss
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
People are people and sometimes it doesnt work out
Well you drive me crazy half the time
If you leave Ill be crawling back for more
Love like this changes who you are
The way you walk way you talk way you say my name
She better hold him tight give him all her love
Thats what they dont see mmmmmm
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And she said
The first date Man I didnt kiss her when I should have
This night is flawless dont you let it go
This here guitar
Help me save me from this crash at last
And I dont mean on the phone santa baby
It must have been the way
Everybody knows that
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
But you come back to what you need
Yes I remember what you said last night
But it didnt
Keep your eyeyes open
Every night for so long baby
I almost didnt notice
The way you love with all you have
Cause darling it was good never looking down
Rose garden filled with thorns
No one could touch the way we
And everybody knows that
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
I dont know how to be something you miss
First thought when I wake up
I know youre not scared of anything at all
The sun is going down
Shes better known
Youre still an innocent
Breathless
And I realize the joke is on me yeah
From three summers back
Stealing other peoples toys
When it was good baby
And I never knew I could feel that much
And a liar and pathetic and alone in life
Uh uh
Time for a little revenge
Something holy not superficial
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
I cant win so I give in
The best people in life are free
And thats what I learned from you
Ill be right here on the ground
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
Dream big aim small
See how far I can go
I was there when you said forever and always
My mistake I didnt know to be in love
And then reality crept in and erased it
And it was overrated
Keep your eyeyes open
Theyll judge it like they know about me and you
Get a look on the inside
If you could stay like that
Slowly educating me
Man you gotta love her
To the diary of me
Shorty Im a make ya
Welcome to New York New York
By the way
I wont let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
The feeling you can know so much
Of what love gave me and took away
You were lookin at me
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
La La La La
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
Is I know something now know something now I didnt before
When I saw you there across the room
But loves got me cornered in the back of the room
Will you take a moment promise me this
Id give all I have honey
Another mess i didnt plan
I will face the world around me
Were burning red
My thoughts will echo your name
But Ill never look
It seems the last thing on your mind
Baby but I figured you out
And now you got me alone
Drew walks by me can he tell that I cant breathe
And youve got a smile
Then I think there is something we all forgot
There aint no accidents in what we do
I can only love you
Way too long
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
I can see the look thats in your eyes
Wont you whisper soft and slow
And Im comfortable
I should have slept with one eye open at night
Theres something there
The way you move when you walk by
Tell me did you sail across the sun
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Running free
I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
Been losing grip
Now Im a rap star
Got em up to there
And that magics not here no more
And I think about summer all the beautiful times
And so long
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
Standing there in my party dress
Welcome to New York
And it was a long time coming
And everybody knows that
And were your cousins late again
Were you just kidding cause it seems to me
Say that you wanna be with me too
Its been waiting for you
But that was when I ruled the world
Instead of just invisible
Thatll have to be something I just say this year
Stood there and watched you walk away
You made a really deep cut
And I wish I could run to you
And Im tired of being last to know
Hold on to spinning around
Uh huh
Waiting for the words
If we just keep dancing like were
Do you even care
Youre so in love that you act insane
Id rather hear the truth
Like harold and martin singing
You will find out
But Ive got a blank space baby
And Im on the bleachers
And you cant wait to move out someday and call your own shots
And you said it reminded you of me
I hold onto the night
Hold on were gonna make it now
Oh
Realize that we wont makeup
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
That youll come in with the rain
Theres nothing stopping me
You saw me there but never knew
A rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite
And shell tease you shell unease you
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
Tell me
Honestly believe youd be there
All at once the rest is history
Thought youd be here by nowTall dark and superman
I didnt really know her that well
Im soaked to the skin youre warm and dry
Like any true love
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Guess I loved you way too much
Then whyd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
I like the way youre everything I ever wanted
So jump then fall
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
But Im only looking at you
When youre fifteen and your first kiss
Cause I dont wanna think about that right now
She is the best thing thats ever been mine
Cause darling Im a nightmare dressed like a daydream
And I see it when Im looking at you
But youre in London and I break down
For just us to know
She was an American girlAngelinas got a pretty face
No
And I think in a while Ill be hypnotized
And it will be a long time long time going
You seem to be just what Ive tried to find
Like the colors in autumn so bright just before they lose it all
I may see
Play it again
Cause baby now we got bad blood
So walk with me
Cant help it if theres no one else
Fearless
Not this time
And the sunset had your lips
You didnt mean it baby
Nothings gonna change not for me and you
Ive never heard silence quite this loud
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
I will face the world around me
Its the first kiss
We both wake in lonely beds in different cities
And that was the moment I knewYou said it in a simple way
And by morning gone was any trace of you
No one can hurt you now
If I could only find the strength to leave
Bend all my rules
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
Lets talk about blood and sweat and tears
Where I lost control
Yeah calling us like were boyfriend and girlfriend
Taken away to the dark side
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Ohthat this is really happening
Oh
But I dont know if I should
Replace your memory everywhere weve ever been
I love you
Keep you second guessing like
And I just wanna tell you
With the sun shining bright
I dont wanna miss you like this
Between now and forever
When we started home it started to rain
Yes yes I can see it now
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Counting my footsteps
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
I know youre saying that youll be here anyway
Oh oh oh
I know places
Talk to the wind talk to the sky
Somethings gone terribly wrong
You are in love
The delicate beginning rush
We stood there in the road
Cause we were happy
Oh just know Im right here hopin
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
And she says lucky you lucky you
And well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
All you had to do was stayI stay out too late
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
To the diary of meShould have been different but
You write me letters
Loves got me tangled tired me too
Shes cheer captain
I like writing their names into songs so theyre ashamed to go in public
Come on baby with me were gonna fly away from here
And the saddest fear comes creeping in
Down the stairs I was there I remember it all too well yeah
So Im taking this chance to say
I wanna be your left hand man
Broken and scarred
You would you would if this was a movie
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
Just try to never grow up never grow up
This love is alive back from the dead
Its gonna take it a while to love again
I got a lump in my throat because
I was begging you Please dont go
You give me everything and nothing
Tell MeYou were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldnt have
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
The way you love with all you have
Ill never judge you
I dont want to jinx my luck
My friends and enemies
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
Should have all worked out
Never a clean break no one here to save me
And I dont think we can solve em
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Its not the best I know
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Im invisible and everyone knows who you are
Dont fade away
Im no one special just another
Loving him was red
Sometimes I get temperamental
And well tell each other things like I love you
You can Jump then fall jump then fall
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Theres a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
Back when I deserved it
And every day is like a battle
Even when the musics gone
I thought heaven cant help me now
Taken away to the dark side
Hope you know its not easy easy for me
Trying to get some help from up above
Just like the mark you knew you were making
The moment I can see it
But you stayed
Think about what i
Nobody ever lets me in
Let me know hows it feel to be under my skinTire swings summer dreams honeysuckle on the breeze
If I drive on drive on drive on
There aint nothing more right babe
Thats what people say mmmmmm
Think of all the boys I havent kissed
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind
Watches
But honey I am noones exception
By the way ohAny day now theyre talking war
Ive got an i heart question mark
And you know everything about me
Cause one second it was perfect now youre half way out the door
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
We go walking down the river all together
To hold on to each other
Oh Oh In the middle of the night
Am I ready for the joy am I ready for the pain
In my life Ive been hammered by some heavy blows
I wonder what youre doing right now
He said the way my blue eyes shined
When it was good baby
Am I ready for the joy am I ready for the pain
Id open up and you would say Hey
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to
That never knocked me off my feet
Lost your mind tryin to get it back
But Id be a game if you would play
When Im in this dream
Til Brad Pitt comes along
Oh
It wasnt just like a movie
How strange that I dont know you at all
I could be your little beauty queen
But Ill bet you want to
But hes a little bit shy
Ill be one of the many saying
livin in a crazy world
Walked in expecting youd be late
My TLC was quite OD ID my facts ID my
I love you when youre singing that song and
But look at the tears here in my eyes
You will find out
Everything is wrong
Is a letter that you never read
I hug your legs and fall asleep
Met her out in Vegas
And take for granted what you have
Chalk it up better luck
Its two AM
You with your switching sides
Trouble trouble troubleI like my music loud
Today was a fairytale
One day we will be remembered
Its like I got this music
You never know if time will tell
Lit through the darkness at 158
I got an i heart question mark
But youre so confused
And I just wish I told you never mind
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
There you are on the street
You can walk away say we dont need this
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
Trying to get my heels back under my head
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
Who you wanted me to be
The light reflects
Is now its getting so much clearer
We wont be sleeping
Cause I I still love you but I cant
Jealousy misery gonna give you what you gave to me
I could tell you his favorite colors green
And you flashback to
To save the world or go to work
I have been looking in trying to read your mind
Christmas lights glisten
New money suit and tie
Live forever never say never
What do you say
Wildest dreams ahha ohh
And they say Ive always known
Buy a oneway ticket on a west bound train
doctor says shes in the clear
It takes five seconds to need you
Everybody knows that
To my lovin bed
And I wont be alone tonight
Lead her up the stairwell
My last request it is
Hed never tell you but he can play guitar
Theres nothing I can do baby to make it go away
You shouldve known that word with what you did with her
But I am not alone
Keep your eyeyes
Youre gonna sing the words wrong
Turn the page its all the rage
Cause Id seen the skyThrowing pennies at the fountain
You and Ill be safe and sound
You held me so close
What we had  a beautiful magic love there
Dont you know that theres nothing I wouldnt do
You wore a dark grey tshirt
Words how little they mean when youre a little too late
And baby now we got bad blood
And put a wreath up on your door
Cause you know I love the players
Who understands you
I thought I had you figured out
A new notch in your belt is all Ill ever be
This mad mad love makes you come running
To make up my mind
Who do you think you are
Holding her hand
Everybody knows that
Ive been thinking maybe
This girl is begging wait wait for me
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
Sleep in heavenly peace
I have known it all this time
Santa honey theres one more thing I really do need the deed
Same old story dear john
Make you feel so BAD
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I dont
Tell me
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
So many walls up I cant break through
There was something wrong it was all my fault
I thought I had you figured out
You better come down here right away
And it aint youI I used to fly
I gotta have you
Makes you wanna run and hide
He found 30 other pieces
She wears high heels
This was the very first page
So dont look at me
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
This love yesterday but now who are you
I know looks can be deceiving
Down came the rain
But turn around turn around oh theyve surrounded you
OhOhBaby
See your face hear my voice in the dark
Til you put me down oh
On the hood of his daddys car
I knew you were trouble when you walked in you were right there you were right there
She should keep in mind
I know I know I just know
Youll see me in hindsight
Oh I cant leave yet
I tell them this is what I do
Beautiful beautiful beautiful
Im aching no past
On the playground wont
Ive burned my bridges had sleepless nights
Now its big black cars and Riviera views
Maybe Im a fast train
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
Just so frustrating intoxicating
You wish it was me
Everybody here
Try and catch me now
No sign of a wall sign of wall
Of what love gave me and took away
And they say little girls are so naive
Wondering what to wear
You and me
Oh In the middle of the night
Inside I still dont know
All my days Ill know your face
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apartnow
What a sad beautiful tragic love affairNew to town with a made up name in the angels city
These hands had to let it go free
But I hope someday youll take me away and save the day yeah
The smokey black nights
Never wanted this never wanna see you hurt
Begging for forgiveness begging for me
With some decorations bought at Tiffanys
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
FireflyMy names Gracie
And I stare at the phone
Counter all your quick remarks
And I can picture it after all these days
Its like it wasnt you
cause its late and your mama dont know
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
Welcome to New York
Come on come along with me
I hope you think that little black dress
Who do you think you are
Im starting to think one day Ill tell the story of us
Cause its worked each time before
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad
Starts to make its way to me
Heart break is the national anthem
Just you and me
You say sorry just for show
I want to know how it feels to be
I cant win so I give in
Na na na na naIts strange to think the songs we used to sing
He tells me about his night
22 oohooh
Yeah oh yeah yeah
Now all we know is dont let go
Gonna give you what you gave to meI was scared of dentists and the dark
I bet youre sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And its always gonna get weird
When you think Tim McGraw
The chain on your neck
With you today
Dont look at me
But you know you got a mean streak
Happy birthday to you
Look at you now look at you now now
Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through
When you think happiness
But I keep cruising
But the very next day you gave it away
All you had to do was stay
Whats wrong with being promiscuous
I could stand up and sing you a song
Everything has changed
Oh oh I love you I love you
Make you feel so BAD
I hear Jerusalem bells aringing
When they said Speak nowLong were the nights when
Its getting dark and its all too quiet
And you come away with a great little story
And all I can say is come closer
Shell take a tumble on you roll you like you were dice
You and I got lost in it
Back now that its just too late
Ill be one of the many saying
Thats when I could finally breathe
I like the way youd sing to me
I wish you would
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Cause thats where you belong
But not another minute
Cause it rains in your bedroom
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
But here I am an open book
Fearless
And I I I like it
I know what I want
Boys and boys and
Faster than the wind passionate as sin ending so suddenly
Cause my first name big last name trouble
Take it easy baby
She could see the cars roll by
On our last night
Talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear in the summer shadeI like glitter and sparkly dresses
She dont even know you
Im so glad to see you smiling
So how can I ever try to be better
Too many cool kids uh uh uh uh whos Taylor Swift anyway ew
And Im reminded without you Id be
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Ill give it to someone special
You threw your arms around my neck
Hell never fall in love he swears
I I I shake it off I shake it off
Youre all I wanted
Im thirteen now
What do you say
You belong with me
Shell open up the door and say Are you insane ane
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
Ive never been there
Back now that its just too late
Dont look at me
No one could touch the way we
Taxi cabs and busy streets
The dust does on the dash
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
X is the shape I drew through your face
Its a perfect passion and I cant get enough
At 10 oclock she hears this screaming
The lights are so bright
Silent night holy night
My exman brought his new girlfriend
I stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
Im sorry mmm
Sit at home and cry like a baby
My mind forgets to remind me
That never bring you back to me
La la la la la la la
Breakin down and coming undone
Dont be afraid well make it out of this mess
If you want hard to get
Body bumped bruised
La la la la la la
Its not like Im giving up who I am for you
I dont know who Im gonna talk to
To write on his heart in
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
Never an honest word
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle
Isnt life sweet
So I tuck you in turn on your favorite night light
The first time you ever saw me cry
Dont need you nowI think you fell off of your cloud today
In my monologue
Why are we pretending this is nothing
I bet youre sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
Or a California loaded gun
You showed me something that I couldnt see
To get knocked off our feet
Time slows down
Wearing your clothes
Break you make you sorry
And if youre missing me
Someday you will
We were the Kings and the Queens
Fearless
Hey Stephen
I dont think so
I might fall in love
If you keep me next to you
If we just keep dancing like were
And another winters on the way
Just let it flow
And I said Im sorry too
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that youve ever seen oh
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
The lights are so bright
And I dont think we can solve them
Theyre in my rear view mirror disappearing now
Well you can take me down with just one single blow
For the next four years in this town
And crossing so many lines
In my extra small white tee
And you knew what it was
Oh Im scared to see the ending
Youll see me
He listens like spring and he talks like June hey hey
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
If youre somewhere
When you think happiness
For you and me someday
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Just waiting for you to walk in
Hes just hiding out on the other side of town
I remember you said Dont leave me here alone
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
They never believed wed really fall in love
Loves pure light
Its a thug story now can you get with that
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
Tall dark and beautiful
You change in time
And thats why hes spinnin round in my head
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why I should be the one you choose
Oh were invisible
I hope you think of me
So glad you were around
But if we loved again I swear Id love you right
Looking in the mirror
Smokey black nights
My one condition is
Ill be five in May
So hurry down the chimney tonightSilent night holy night
Oh baby let me miss you
That had a tendency of gettin stuck
Look at you now look at you now now
And they said Speak now
And this love came back to me
By the way
Shes got her hopes up
Hope the the world never tore that out of you
So I thought
And say you want me
I only ask that you wont go again
Double platinum wherever she go
And everything that we could be
But if you only knew me
I couldve rolled your yard
And baby now we got bad blood
Just like our lastI said remember this moment in the back of my mind
Spinning me around
You made me crazy too long
You make me crazier crazier crazier
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
Well Im doing alright
Ill follow you follow you home
Staring at the sunset babe
When you know youre bout to cry
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
On the sidelines wishing for right now
Ohoh
Come back be here come back be here
And the sinking feeling starts
Boy you might have me believing
A love thats gonna last
Wonder what youre doing right nowSometimes I wonder how its gonna feel
Girl what are you thinking
The best people in life are freeThe way you look the way you laugh
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Oh oh
You played in bars you play guitar
And they get what they want cause youre gone
And we pretended it could last forever
And it was a long time coming
Vanished when I saw your face
Cause baby now we got bad blood hey
We ditch the whole scene
Everything will be alright
With whatever talent money buys
Come on baby with me were gonna fly away from here
On every day you loved me
Cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
See the vultures circling dark clouds
I never talked about the days he called
Something so beautiful and free
Hes got everything youd wanna be
We show off our different scarlet letters
I know that we could work it out somehow
Im acting like a girl
Know exactly where it leads but I
You can feel it on the way home way home
I aint jealous of you
Everything is wrong
I have ever heard
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him
I like the way youd hold me
Uh uh
All you had to do was stay
I dont hangout at smokey bars but I know well see you there
Keep your feet ready
She should keep in mind
Im reaching out and I just cant tell you why
This is surely not what you thought it would be
And you love the game
Over you for real
This hope is treacherous
And I could tell you now but baby never mind
So take a look what youve done
Or was it just like those promises you made on Our last night
So Ill go sit on the floor
The girl in the dress
Ill catch you Ill catch you
Ive been spending the last eight months
And I see it when Im looking at you
Before I met him
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen
Burning it down
Once youre gone I know your memoryll
I thought I had you figured out
You dont know about me
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye
When we were happy
I say I hate you we break up you call me I love you
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
I was so sane and grounded
No sign of a wall sign of wall
The same guitar Ive always played
This is my SNL monologue
And ill bet you thought youd beat me
She should keep in mind
Are we out of the woods yet
Will tell you its true
Now its too late for you and your white horse to catch me now
if you need love Ill be standing at your door
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Do you recognize me
But I do
Kinda girl
So watch me strike a match
Bigger than the rest
And for once you let go
And shes got everything that I have to live without
Its beautiful wonderful dont you ever change
Screamed your name
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
The mirror saw her cry
I didnt read between the lines
Cause Im not feeling anything at all
And then you feel so low
You come and pick me up no headlights
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
He still hasnt called
Well its quite not London
The drought was the very worst
The words that you whispered
She looks at me like Im a trend and shes so over it
Calling commotion to my emotions
Never left you in the corner
Marry me Juliet youll never have to be alone
The days doin nothin
Just close your eyes
You and Ill be safe and sound
Stealing other peoples toys
And all I really wanna do is be next to you
Im hiding from you and your soul of ice
And thats the way I loved youOnce upon a time
You made us proud you made us proud proud
Have you been played for endless hours
That Im really ok when Im not
Now at school
And youll leave got places to be and Ill be OK
I might fall in love
The way you love with all you have
You play it back
Couldve loved you all my life
If I could write a book on how this hurts
On your wedding dress
Today was a fairytale
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And we caught onto something
They rode 100 floors up just to come back down
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
I thought I had you figured out
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And I say whoever said that didnt have too far to fall
I got no one to believe in
That should send me runnin
Just know Im right here hopin
Forcing laughter faking smiles
That I never heard you say
Tell me why
Its a warm May beautiful day
Im heading out tonight traveling light
But its mine Im gonna make it mine
I never had a lesson so sweet
So take a look what youve done look what youve done
And I coulda spent a life with you
Im not gonna comment on that
Hes got his heart on his sleeve
But I believe in whatever you do
You never met a mirror
Drive out of the city away from the crowds
Cant stop wont stop moving
So why cant you see
Come now running headlong
Girl what are you thinking
And you dont know what you dont know
Oh its so sad to think about the good times you and I
The rest of the world was black and white
And I will fall in love again
These are the hands of fate
Without me without me without me
Take it easy baby
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Lantern burning flickered in my mind for only you
I dont wanna miss you like this
We can make the perfect couple
For the things that she does
This is my musical monologue
suddenly he cheats sent from above
Your dance your drive You make me feel alive
Oh dont you ever grow up
Show me a light
I dont know about you
And I thought was a star
But darling we found wonderland
Down came the rain
Follow you follow you home
Im so gangster you can find me baking cookies at night
My name is up in lights
But just baby get along with me
Girl that boy is trouble
Ill bet shes beautiful that girl he talks about
And I just think you should think you should know
And shell never know your story like I do
You lift my feet off the ground
Dont flatter yourself that was never my intention
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
I thought I had you in my hand
But i cant believe you made me
Hey all you had to do was stay
Come running headlong into my arms
And Id be smart to walk away
I cant take my eyes off of you
These headlights they just wanna fade
if you look like an angel
You never saw it coming
Like were made of starlight
I remember your bare feet down the hallway
Seen you fall seen you crawl on your knees eh eh
And by morning gone was any trace of you
What I wanted
Soon shes gonna find
Like passing notes in secrecy
And you just see right through me
Not where the story line ends
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
Youll be alright
Oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
But here we are in so deep
That youll come in with the rain
This is the last time Im asking you why
Permanent marker
Pass around his old guitar
When freedom was waiting down at the station
I felt your arms twisting around me
Wildest dreams ahha ohh
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once youre already flying through the free fall
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
Hey Stephen
Theres your trouble
You and I got lost in it wonderland
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
Oh yeah mandolin
Cause look just what Ive found
This lifesweeter than fiction
To realign a star or two
And I was crying on the staircase
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
I just drive on by
I guess what you wrote on a paper
Ive got my eye on the door
Swore Id never let a man in my way
Cause I loved you when when you
Even when were old were still gonna be
Remember the footsteps remember the words said
So I question everything I do
Thats what people say mmmmmm
Even when youre sleeping sleeping
Because it cant be were already through
Maybe I shouldve seen the signs shouldve read the writing on the wall
Trust me mine is better
A love so strong
And hes all that I need to fall into
Were a crooked love in a straight line down
Look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause
And it never wouldve gone away no
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin
This is the last time Im asking you this
And now its all too late so you see
And youll be mine and Ill be yours
Who were you before you even knew me
It was months and months of back and forth
But the easy ride was never my ambition
Oh oh
Youre so in love that you act insane
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
I walk in here with a beat up case
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
But if this was a movie youd be here by now
Dear John I see it all now that youre gone
Youre the only one who gets me
That when you feel the world is crashing
To watch them lay her down
And remember what we were fighting for
If you only knew me
Everybody saying
And I dont know how it gets better than this
And its moving so fast
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
Stupid boy
We was on D like DOC remember that Remember that
In red lipstick
And life was never worse but never better
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Today was a fairytale
Santa baby a 54 convertible too light blue
32 and still growin up now
All because of Ellen
I hear the preacher say Speak now or forever hold your peace
My imaginations running away
You never know if time will tell
Must have been somewhere between
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Dont look at me
I know you cant see me here
You can see it with the lights out lights out
And I feel perfectly fine
Youre here Youre eyes are looking into mine
You fought it hard like an army guy
Ill give it to someone special
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Could it be so hard
Stay beautiful
Before
Theres the silence theres my last chance
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see
Hit the ground hit the ground hit the ground oh oh
But youve got something they dont
All the timeI am not the kind of girl
The village is aglow
So he could wear you down
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And he just might make me smile
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
I I I shake it off I shake it off
Every night for so long baby
Dont fade away
Youre the kind of man who makes me sad
Were happy free confused and lonely at the same time
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Until I do
You gotta come on come on
And now youre onto something I I I say
Say youll see me again
And time can heal but this wont so if youre coming my way just dont
I want you back but its coming down to nothing
Thats how you got the girlClear blue water high tide came and brought you in
You aint worth all that ten dollars and a six pack
And I can teach you bad bad things
But you are not the kind of boy
And youre mommas waiting up and you think hes the one
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I would have stayed up and Made Up You
Your very first day
You can hear it in the silence silence
But I dont cause
Shes not a saint
And the crazy thing is I dont know if Im ever gonna feel that way again
And time stands still when youre nowhere bound
On a history book page
Wont you come on over baby We can shake shake shake
Thats what they dont know mmmmmm
Who do you think you are
Its how you get the girl girl
I was enchanted to meet you
And I hope you know that every time I dont
And dont hate me for loving you
Because it cant be were already through
You can call me TSweezy
And baby all I see is you
Im sorry eh eh
No matter what you say I still cant believe
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
You know that Ill be there time and again
So fall back on me
Asking God if he could play it again
I love you to the moon and backI remember tears streaming down your face
This year to save me from tears
Jump then fall into me into me
Its sweeter than sweeter
Where have you been
And I cant hear one single word they say
And I am not your typical princess
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
Dont look at me
For all those wishes on planes
But someday Ill be living in a big ole city
Lets talk about what you did to get here
Inside and out
This revolution throw your hands up
In red lipstick
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Asking you to stay
Shes got her hopes up
And i dont wanna lose your face
Whos gonna hold you
They cant take whats ours
So now youre thinking bout
Seems like theres always someone who disapproves
This lifesweeter than fiction
Oh I stare at the phone
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
And they said Speak now
Change a southern night for you
Thats what I learned from you oh yeahHit the ground hit the ground hit the ground oh oh
Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
I wore a dress
Over your sad empty town
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
The weight of the world
Said are you there
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
Cause were young and were reckless
Just me and Britney
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
I wanna be your left hand man
Listen as the crowd would sing
Someday Ill be living in a big ole city Why you gotta be so
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
Cause I remember it all all all too well
What did you need from me
Gone
Let me want you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
So Imma stay through it all
Asking God if he could play it again
What do you say
Got to the hallway
When I jumped in
Permanent marker
32 and still growin up now
I just like hangin out with you all the time
Ooh ooh I love you I love you
Youve been good busier than ever
Thats how you get the girl
Youre not sorry no no oh
Youve just gotta keep your eyes open
Ive never been on the outside
The songs he plays just living free
And theyll be chasing their tails tryin to track us down
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
And guns
What will I do when my love comes to call
Could you tell me what did I do
But who knows what goes through his mind
Now I know where life lessons are
You sat down in the car
To the diary of me
The years went by
Im shining like fireworks
Oh oh
Makes you feel so empty inside
And baby all I see is you
I do recall a good while back
No no no no
Cause youve burned them out
But every night with us is like a dream
Whos gonna hold you
I never been on a plane
Theyll just keep on shining bright
You held your head like a hero
Did he forget you
Hey hey what do you say
Theres nothing left to beg for
Well here I am an open book
Put my name at the top of your list
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
Why you took everything i had oh baby
What happens when you wake up to see that youve lost
Dream about
Oh dont fade away baby
In the middle of the night
To hold on to each other
Break you make you sorry
Christmas must be something
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
When it was hard to take
and they put your picture in a frame
This is life before you know who youre gonna be
Lay low Im a mission rebel
I wish you would come back
And Ive loved in shades of wrong
And my old faded blue jeans
And didnt he pray too
All I knew this morning when I woke
Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
A thousand smiles
That someday you will find me
These hands had to let it go free
It might just break me
After everything that day
Your time is running out
TSwift and TPain rapping on the same track
You go I hope you think of me
I had it all what a shame what a fall now
Im just sitting here planning my revenge
But I dont wanna go there anymoreThis is wrong but I cant help but feel like
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney
Never a clean break no one here to save me
In my monologue
Had me in the palm of your hand
Firefly you drew me to you
Dear John I see it all now that youre gone
Fight for what weve worked for all these years
I always forget to tell you I love you I love you forever
I guess youre in New York today
We showed um all up
No ones ever burned you nothings ever left you scarred
Dont you think nineteens too young
Will tell you its true
But the cycle ends right now
Wind in my hair I was there I remember it all too well
That we wont forget this Sunday
Just like a line in an old love letter
You always knew how to push my buttons
The way you move when you walk by
The lights are so bright
Shoes purse hair tied back
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
So here you are at my window
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
I wish you would I wish you would
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
Stay
Yeah ohhh
Wondering what to wearYou walk in here with your guitar man
And I know all the steps up to your door
I might fall in love
As I paced back and forth all this time
On the way home
And then you say
And there was nothing else I could do
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
I guess the storm is over for you
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Out on 441
Cant help myself
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar
Than love and lie
Head back toward the Milky Way
If only you had seen what you know now then
You didnt mean it baby
Were you just kidding
Youre gonna sing the words wrong
Trying just to get the girl
Died for you
Didnt matter where Id been
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
You spin me around
Flash forward and were taking on the world together
Wish you could only see
Santa baby forgot to mention one little thing
But every night with us is like a dream
Dont fight me
And then you walk right by Im screaming out inside
You took a swing I took it hard
He walked around my life
I know what I want
Fix my heart put on my makeup
Its a showdown showdown and nobody comes to save you now
Lately I can never tell
Heres to silence
Wondering love how Ill feel today
And baby now we got bad blood hey
We ditch the whole scene
Maybe he knew that when he saw me
In my monologue
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
Never a clean break no one here to save me
People throw rocks at things that shine
Youre perfect for me why arent you here tonight
Fearless
Coz im not scared
Give you one last wave
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
It just all comes back But he never does
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure
The time is gonna come when youre so mad you could cry
But you know you wouldnt
Dont turn away now
Flew me to places Id never been
Makes me run for cover when youre around
Well take this way too far
But she wears short skirts
And yet shes the same
I havent seen it in a while
You tend to treat me like
Call a cab
In your life youll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team
Oh yeah all right
I remember oh I remember
This is a state of grace
Since she brought you down
Itll leave you breathless
Or an Asian Island
Got a long list of exlovers
You got that long hair slicked back white tshirt
She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
You belong with me
I said This time Ive had enough
Ill give it to someone special
I know weve got a lot to say between now and foreverSomething about me didnt fit into your perfect world
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt tight little skirt
But loves got me cornered in the back of the room
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
And
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
On the outside looking in
You can feel it on the way home
And dont rip my heart out
The simple things in life are always new
I cant have it I cant have it any other way
And it said
Feeling lucky today got the sunshine
Still got your laugh your ghost your jacket
I like my windows down
Say youll see me again
Oh Im the guy who plays the mandolin
You look like bad news
Anything
I want to be where
And baby now we got bad blood hey
Its sweeter than fiction
All I know is a simple name
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
I know that you aint used to no
Well I was sixteen when suddenly
Take away the pain
All the ways you made me feel alive
And I guess I wished on a plane
What I wanted
Dream big aim small
You search the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
With the wrong one
Today was a fairytale
Revolutionaries wait
And it aint you
Can you imagine no love pride deepfried chicken
Now Im standing alone in a crowded room and were not speaking
It feels like one of those nights
Wonderful and strange
We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you
Hey I cant take it back look where Im at
But who knows what goes through his mind
Oh losing him was blue like Id never known
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name
Before fire could catch me
Counting every bird
Its a scene and were out here in plain sight
I ran off the plane
Id be
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
You made a really deep cut
You shouldve knownYou with your words like knives
Going back to Nashville
2 AM who do you love
Six months gone and Im still reaching
Oh oh oh oh
Talk to you forever
I stop pretending
You make the sweetest sight at the window
Until Ive forgotten all their names
Yeah yeah
When you see these eyes
I cant win so I give in
Ive been giving out chances every time
Well you stood there with me in the doorway
Say that well be together
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
Are you so far above me
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
This lifesweeter than fiction fiction
I sneak in and see your friends
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
Your eyeswider than distance
Welcome to New York
Mhmmm
Reminds me that theres room to grow hey hey
When everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
With my hair undone
He loves to argue born on the seventeenth
Its a bad sign bad sign
In the bottom of the top drawer
But I swore I was fine
Theres gotta be more
Losing him was blue like Id never known
Oh yeah all right
When I met you on the outskirts of town
Look at me
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Cant help it if theres no one else
What I was thinking of
And for one desperate moment there
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
We never go out of styleLooking at it now
And letting go and no one knows
One without a permanent scar
And then you feel so low
Fresh on the pavement
Tell me what did I do
Its like I got this music
And I forget about you long enough
And then youre on your very first date and hes got a car
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I dont
Ive walked
Christmas must be something more
Hey Hey TSwizzle TSwizzle
Dont you think I was too young
Yeah Yeah
Come back come back come back to me like
But who knows what goes through his mind
You better run
And I realize the blame is on me
Now we got problems
I can read you like a magazine
It should all add up
Trouble trouble trouble
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
Something keeps me holding on to nothing
Never thought Id see itI still remember the look on your face
If you ever wondered
Come and trim my Christmas tree
Fell down a rabbit hole
See how far I can go
I love you and thats all I really know
But Im feeling 22
Wasnt it you that told me
Cause they got the cages they got the boxes
And it would be a fine proposition
I leaned up against your car
I dont know why
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
It could still be simple
You were country lovin really somethin for three months and a half
When I left I wanted you to chase after me
Come back come back come back to me like
Oh yeah
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Heart break is the national anthem
You smile and walk away
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
Yeah I slept in my makeup again
After you held me is that just what you do
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
Dont say Yes run away now
Got the radio on my old blue jeans
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright
Ooh lifes so sweet right here
Every night from the radio
With his head in his hands and shes just 7 miles away
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Two paper airplanes flying flying flying
Girl you got everything
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
I just drive on by drive on drive on
But this love is oursLast night I heard my own heart beating
Yeah
It feels like one of those nights
Just to hear you say my name
That I dont want you to go ohoh
This is the last straw
Where were you
Cause I never couldve dreamed you up this good
Living in the lie
We found wonderland
Somethings made your eyes go cold
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything yeah
Tell me why
Come on come on dont leave me like this
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Little did I know
Was I out of line
Autumn rain window pane looking how the leaves change
And that dont offer me much time
And swords and weapons that you use against me
And told me you loved me
I might miss you bad but
Are you so far above me
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
Saying This is it Ive had enough cause like
We are never ever ever getting back together
And I need you like a heartbeat
So dim that spotlight tell me things like
Ooh we called it off again last night
And I said
Then jumping on me waking me up
Smokey black nights
All is calm and all is bright
You take my hand and drag me head first
Or the girl living next door
Id never let you go
Dont you see the starlight starlight
Cause one second it was perfect
Everything is wrong
Wont lose you again
So take a look what youve done
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doorsWe were both young when I first saw you
And I wouldve been so happy
Blowing through a mountain
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Welcome to New York
Oh BabyHere we are
Jumping in without no safety net
Ohoh ohohoh
There aint nothing bout you there aint nothing bout you
Lock me up in a dark room
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
Blowin through a valley
You made a really deep cut
Written on the back of my hand
Everything is wrong
And theres a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
Shes cheer captain
Is the one who didnt show
We are too busy dancing
You can get high on a first kiss
I shouldve let you know
We wait for trains that just arent coming
And you open your eyes into mine
You held on tight to me
And Im down to my last breath
Were getting stronger now
Now the old king is dead Long live the king
And baby Ive got nowhere to go
Just pretending
And the note that said
Come back come back come back to me like
And i dont wanna turn around
And I guess I wished on a plane
You got that long hair slicked back white tshirt
I know places
And life was never worse but never better
Was I mistaken
That you didnt look again into
And thats the way I loved you
Gone and spilled my coffee
Screaming This is absurd
And everybody looks at her
Ive been being patient
God smiles on my little brother
Every time you smile I smile
Its so much colder than I thought it would be
Takes me home
Youre still an innocent
The way you look the way you laugh
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
Cause baby now we got bad blood
Starin at the fire
Im dying to see how this one ends
I never dreamed of this
And all I want is just what Ive got
And come over here to say
I used to get when you would call
Theres your trouble
We used to get high on the first kiss
And you were wild and crazy
Yeah
I dont think you do
You know it used to be mad love
Theyll tell you Im insane
Shes always asks me who Im dating
He sees everything black and white
Oh yeah all right
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
Hes the song in the car I keep singing dont know why I do
So baby drive slow
The beautiful kind making up for lost time
Take it easy baby
You take one look at me cause thats what it cost
And its so quiet in the world tonight
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
All I need is on the other side of the door
Are we in the clear yet
You know I havent seen you around before
And dont rip my heart out
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time
Yeah
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Did you not write it down
Was there some reason Im not aware of
Uh oh oh
But I think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay stay stay
Flew me to places Id never been
Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa oh oh ohhh
Forever and ever here
And life was never worse but never better never better
Is this in my head I dont know what to think
And people say things that bring you to your knees
Oh all my friends are turning green
Ive got no one to believe in
Feelin like I just lost a friend
SO baby come hold me tight cause II
Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
Only sound only sound that you heard was No
Cause nothings as it seems
And this love came back to me
If I didnt know he loves me so
the hope of an american boy
He still hasnt called
Wishing the call was from you
And said Im sorry I didnt make it
And your mothers telling stories about you on a tee ball team
In only a little while Ill cry
I wish you would
Ill follow you follow you home
God its so painful
Im lying here in invisible arms
I take a step back let you go
Your smile you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on
And when the sun came up you were lookin at me
Kiss me on the sidewalk
You change in time
REVENGE My list of things to do this week
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
As were lying on the couch
Im gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
That someday you will find me
You go I hope you think of me
I remember
Im not sure how I got there
Cause we were both young when I first saw youHey Stephen
Somebody else gets what you wanted again
And every time I look at you its like the first time
Watching all my life go by
Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
I would wait forever and ever ever and ever
Its kinda hard to aim
Oh
Im feeling like I dont know you
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
Baby this is what we do
and sometimes I think of you late at night
Last time Im asking you thisI was reminiscing just the other day
Anytime you want me to
Two AM riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
And I knew from the first note played
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
Welcome to New York
in wildest dreams
And people like me wanna believe you when you say youve changed
Everything changed when you took me to town
And you cant sit still
I realize your laugh is the best sound
We ooh getting back together ohhh
When I ask how long you think youre gonna be
He says Baby girl whats wrong with you
But aint it funny how
Youre beautiful
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
And I cant breathe without you
And youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
The stakes are high the waters rough
Every time the things got rocky yeah
My friends and enemies
Theyll tell you Im insane
Or were you someones best friend
Come back Ill be with you someday
Eight times now and I still remember
I think you know its true
I know you wanna talk about me
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar
The best soy latte that you ever had  and me
And rub it in so deep salt in the wound like youre laughing right at me
I remember
And I dont know
Id never seen it before
Back up baby back up
And I just wanna see you back at my front door
And now I see now I see now I see
Stay
Until I do
I didnt bring her here
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
Down the stairs you were there you remember it all
Cause thats all Ive ever known
I said Leave but all I really want is you
Welcome to New York
Nowhere to hide
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Oh its so sad to think about the good times you and I
How could I have ever believed
Mmm I cant help myself
Standing in a nice dress
Im far away but I never let you go
But now weve stepped into a cruel world
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
Run as fast as you can
Ooh ooh come a little closer
And we were happy
To see that little girls smile
That Im the one
Eh eh
We could be a beautiful
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
He was long gone when he met me
With your hair all sticking up
But it said enough
But I just thought how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you
I have known it all this time
Cant call it love if you aint in it
Minds change like the weather
She was in love she was beautiful and free
Because I love your handshake meeting my father
Cause I I know places we can hide
And the sparks flyIm so glad you made time to see me
I didnt swear She didnt even swear
Na na na na na na na na na
Could this be better
At least thats what people say mmmmmm
My fears my hopes and dreams
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
And I discovered that my castles stand
Drunk and grumbling on about how I cant sing
Hey hey what do you say
Thats the closest youll see me
Youll be in another town
We had a beautiful magic love there
Words I said drowned out by the rain
With Drops of Jupiter in his hair hey hey
Turn the page its all the rage
In wonderland
He said Sir theres been an accident
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
I hope you think that little black dress
Im lightning on my feet
And I could go on and on on and on and I will
I threw my phone across the room at you
And you know for me its always you
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
In permanent marker
the hope of an american boyWell she was an American girl
Hey
Was I mistaken
Im really gonna miss you picking fights
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
And Im not Im not oh
One minute I held the keys
All the roses
Come back be here come back be here
Drifting through the ocean
Dont you think I was too young
When you feel the world is crashing
On my way to letting go
Uh oh hey
Lets talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
This love is alive back from the dead
And tell her youre coming home
So if the chain is on your door I understand
This path is reckless
Somehow get the best of me
Still got the same old number just in case
Waited for something to come along
The world is spinning round
But can you feel this magic in the air
An I dont wanna get there too soon
Dont say Yes run away now
Right when I was just about to fall
The rain we thought would last forever and ever forever
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face
And I know its long gone
Dont say Yes run away now
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
And Ill write your nameMidnight
And dont you know
And may all your Christmases be white
We snuck into the circus
Well they can talk forever they just dont know betterHere you are now
Cause we never go out of style
But can you feel this magic in the air
Ever since youve been gone
Every little piece love
I should just tell you to leave cause I
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
What if Im standing in your closet trying to talk to you
You belong with me
No sign of a wall sign of wall
Ill put his picture down
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Recalling words we said
When Im mad at all the lovebirds
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
But I feel a responsibility
He says What youve heard is true but I
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
She looks at life like its a party and shes on the list
And for the first time whats past is past
Youre drowning youre drowning youre drowning
La la la
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
And I cant trust anything now
When Im with you
Never knew that I could feel this much
And soon enough youre best friends
Cause we never go out of style
And I might be okay
But those days are over
Face to face but never eye to eye
Will it be filled with hope and desire
You belong with me
I think her everpresent frown is a little troubling
And thats how it works
And the message that I left when I called
I hope you remember
All the better just to please you
I shouldnt be asking myself Why
the greatest living hero that ever was
Braced myself for the Goodbye
And its all about you baby
And I played you for endless hours
Oh daddy can I go with you
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
Id rather live a life of gold with a perfect chick
Back now that its just too late
But I do
Its time
The lights are so bright
And Ill do anything you say
HallelujahUh oh oh
But I dont wanna go there anymore
But they never blind me
Hey Its a thug story
And I dont think we can solve em
Honey where are you
You be you and Ill be me
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down
I gotta have you
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
From the one thing I thought would never leave me yeah
Winds of change blew you away from me
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Spinning and turning
Are covered up in pictures of you
And I had the best days with you
Id go back in time and change it but I cant
But the story of us might be ending soon
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
Fall back on me
These hands had to let it go free
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Laughed in the dark
Dont you know that theres nothing I wouldnt do
Nice to meet you I can teach you
Come on come on
Or maybe its you and your sick need
You wear your best apology
Off into the night
I didnt bring you up
We were built to fall apart
Am I ready for the kiss am I ready for the stars
You look like my next mistake
This is the last time Im asking you why
Missed yourself
I go back to December all the time
Remember when we couldnt take the heat
Should have fit like a glove
and I know the mistake Id be making
See how far I can go
Its the morning of your very first day
Cant call it love if you aint in it
Everything is wrong
Cause we were happy
It takes everything in me not to call you
Its your freshman year and youre gonna be here
But Im too tired to fight
It feels just like a day
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Spelling out your name
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me talk to me
All you had to do was stay
And its about to be Halloween
except ending
And I dont think we can solve em
And when youre close I feel like coming undone
So take a look what youve done
Till the gravitys too much
We Were happyI got a little thing I call self control
Lets walk away
You belong with me
So why did you go away
Screaming Im in love with you
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
Cause lately I dont even know what page youre on
Wasnt it you that told me
Remember when you thought Id take a loss
But I am not alone
Cause Im feeling things Ive never felt before
Now youre half way out the door
I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of 45
Oh yeah
Your eyes are dancing
Find things they never found
Have you been played for endless hours
Everythings on fire
Lets talk about what you did to get here
I like my trucks a little
Distance timing breakdown fighting
So heres something you should know that is for sure
With no one to impress
In burning red
But youre friction
Flew me to places Id never been
You pull my chair out and help me in
And the battle was long its the fight of our lives
Unsure of turning you away
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
I I I shake it off I shake it off youve got to
Im fine just a bit of a mess
Baby you hold the key
And say life on musical road is rough conditions
And we know its never simple never easy
Hes complicated hes irrational
Welcome distraction welcome distraction
And theyll be chasing their tails tryin to track us down
When everythings gonna go just right
Red letters that I wrote on the wall
You almost ran the red cause you were looking over at me
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
With a beautiful boy
So many things that I forgot to say
Nothing made sense until the time I saw your face
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
This year to save me from tears
Thats when I could finally breathe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
I wish we could go back
Cause now my name is up in lights but I think you got it right
Were you a present from a father to a son
Miscommunications lead to fallout
Every single time I come on this show
September saw a month of tears
Count them as you find a day new
Youre still an innocent
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
Oh oh oh
Were drivin down the road
Maybe this year Ill give it to someone special
Im no one special just another
Id be breaking all my rules to see you
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I write your name I write your name
And Im only me when Im with you
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want
But I dont believe you baby
And so it goes
Mmmm
That cuts me to the core
Youre still an innocent
Dont look at me
Firefly you drew me to you
And dont lose the way that you dance around in your pjs getting ready for school
And life was never worse but never better
You say this crazy worlds come undone
Its like a million little stars
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was Goodbye
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
Take a deep breath then jump then fall into me
Stay stay stay
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Put my name at the top of your list
And theyre all laughing
To stand back where you stood
Its how you get the girl girl Yeah yeah
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Id rather do
Christmas must be something
And I can feel you like your slipping through my hands
I guess its true that love was all you wanted
Like were made of starlight starlight
We found wonderland
I was screaming long live that look on your face
The cracks down the middle
If I was a stupid girl
And its a beautiful day
Maybe I was naive
Going back to Naaaaahh
So this is me swallowing my pride
And when they call your name
With just me and my baby
The street looks when its just rained
Wasnt really from your heart
The way you love with all you have
Looking in the mirror
Going back to Nashville
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
Why dont you call it a loss
And it was enchanting to meet you
Ill be right here on the ground
Dont wait or say a single vow
And you could know ohoh oh oh
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
I can make out
Ooh just wanna stay right here
In the back of my mind making me feel like
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey
Cause baby now we got bad blood
Cause I get a little crazy
I used to think that we were forever ever
Welcome to New York
Come morning light
I need you I need you
If you had never come out of the blue
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Think of my head on your chest
Red lips and rosy cheeks
I wanna be your left hand man
There was one thing I knew would never leave me
If you hadnt left me waiting in the cold
And I am not your typical princess
Cant stop wont stop grooving
The simple things in life are always new
To give love then take it away
Hes so tall and handsome as hell
You come around and the armor falls
Ive got a stack of papers so high
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
I was in your sights you got me alone
You were gonna be a doctor a movie star poet at a nobel seminar
And I wouldve been so happy
Baby what about the ending
Before she said a word I knew it was her
The waves
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Comes out just when you need it to
Didnt he need you bad enough
Everybody knows that
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming Why
These hands had to let it go free
It would be a fine proposition
She knows you shes got Bette Davis EyesI live down the street in a broken down house
And now i wonder to myself
You didnt mean it baby
Baby were the new romantics
Hey Joe Im doing real well
This night is sparkling dont you let it go
I could be your little beauty queen
YeahShe cant see the way your eyes
When you left her all alone and never told her why why
Then you come around again and say
Your name forever the name on my lips
That July 9th
Never an honest word
Its alright just wait and see
You stayed outside till the morning light
You forgive you forget but you never let it go
The only one whos got enough of me to break my heart
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Guess you gotta run sometimes
The tricky thing
Than have to say goodbye
You can hear it in the silence silence
Everything has changed
And we pretended it could last forever
And we talk and windowshop
I know Im not a little girl anymore
Its alright just wait and see
And dont hate me for loving you
Now its too late for you and your white horse to come around
All roadsthey lead me here
Get a look on the inside
Keep your eyeyes openIsnt it funny how many times we can say
Now that youre close I feel like coming undone
Without knowing anything at all
Anytime you want me to
Your eyeswider than distance
And this love came back to me
Never thought wed have a last kiss
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
You would before you said Its not that easy
Its kinda like a code yeah
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
What a sad beautiful tragic beautiful tragic beautiful
So shame on me now
Why tell me why
Feel the warmth
And Im not perfect you could say
Im on a boat whoa oh
With a smile baby babyCorys eyes are like a jungle
Peace love
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Do you still feel like you know what youre doing
And baby now we got bad blood heyYour beautiful eyes
But youre coming undone
And now you ask about you and i
But here in the now comes in
You said youd be here
It came to me and where well say goodbye
I know your favorite songs
And all that you were
It must have been the way
If the high was worth the pain
Cause we never go out of style
My worlds a little colder now
Something happens when everybody finds out
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you
Dont you worry your pretty little mind
I dont know about you
All those times that you didnt leave
He stands over the hospital bed
Heart all wrapped up
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
You are in love true love
In the middle of the night
in a field behind your yard
Welcome to New York
Wasnt it you that told me
But theres one thing missing
Laughed in the dark
Youre the kind of reckless
Dont fade away
Keep your eyeyes open
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed
La la la la la la la
I think that youve found you even
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
Even if its just in your
And I saw the story on the news
I can still feel your arms
Ill never judge you
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
And all I really wanna do is be next to you
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Knowing that Im strong enough to let you go
Headlights pass the window pane I think of you
And right there where we stood was holy ground
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
In my mind
And you love the game
Well just drive down this road and pray it doesnt end
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
You were my best four years
Didnt it all seem new and exciting
Thats the closest youll see me
Than love and lie
This night is flawless dont you let it go
I didnt even say anything I What
You pull me in
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Simply stated
Cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
This night is sparkling dont you let it go
I keep going back over things we both said
Keep your eyeyes open
Dont you ever grow up just stay this little
And I never never saw you coming
Nothing can harm you here
At a sunset the same night
Little taste of Heaven
Ill be eightyseven youll be eightynine
You said forever and always yeahI could go back to every laugh
Uh oh uh oh
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
And Im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me yeah
And Ill write your name
If we just keep dancing like were
Its getting cold
Until Brad Pitt comes alongToday was a fairytale
Oh I remember you driving to my house
Must have been somewhere between
She cant see the way your eyes
It wont be easy taking her today
Everything is wrong
Turn the page its all the rage
Maybe well last
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Not knowing it will be a long time going
Cause it looks so good
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Walk to my car dig out my keys
You always let someone come in between
Strangers silence makes me wanna take the stairs
Maybe Im a storm front
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
The final blow hits you
And we pretended it could last forever in wonderland
I dont need you but I do I do I do
Change anything anything
Let me tell you now youre the lucky one
You need to hear me out
Will my love come in a bowl of fire
I wanna know who you are
Yeah I said Leave but all I really want is you
And I wont be alone tonight
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
Something bad about Kanye
Keep your eyeyes open
And what do you do when hes next to you
But if theyre half as stubborn as me
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
While she waits up
As we sit
I used to let you choose
Like starlight starlight
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
You had me crying for you honey
Keep your eyeyes open
But Ill hold you through the night until you smile
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Or anything like me
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
But there were Christmases when you were mine
Who understands you
Ive got security lining this stage
Ohoh ohoh ohCome on gather round Im gonna tell you how the fire went out
Cause I I know places we can hide
Wake up and smell the breakup
I know its right for you
I swear Ill be with you someday
And it all leads to this  our first kiss
Follow procedure remember Oh wait you got amnesia
They can talk forever they just dont know better
Next to mine
You two are dancing in a snow globe round and round
Its a new soundtrack
You walk me to the car
And look the eagle in the eye
Cleaning up that mess
Its been waiting for you
As far as Im concerned youre
Im spinning around Im spinning around
We could ever be the same
In the bottom of the top drawer
And it wouldve felt like
Would be bad for your health
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Thats never seen a boat
You can see that Ive been crying
I cant even look at you
Cried the whole way home
But the very next day you gave it away
I always get it
I dont wanna need you this way
When you play the fool
And thats how it works
Ill leave my window open
growing up on Grandview avenue
It was the best night never would forget how he moved
Than have to say goodbye
You wore a mask now thats broken too
I get drunk on jealousy
When they gave us our trophies
He said hed be here
Who you are is not what you did
So I question everything I do
Take a deep breath girl
He didnt like it when I wore high heels
All you had to do was stay
But can you feel this magic in the air
To make them stop it
Until I do
We are alone with our changing minds
Like were made of starlight starlight
Youre in loveWere all bored were all so tired of everything
And talking turned to screams
Theres nothing
She had one little promise she was gonna keep
The best people in life are free
I dont even know if Im ever going back
With this song for you
So baby make me fly
And leave this in my past
You are in love true love
To roll your eyes at honey
Think we can solve em
And this is when the feeling sinks in
Love is different
Our song is the slamming screen door
Every sky was your own kind of blue
I try not to fall apart
My mama says that itll be alright
Today was a fairytaleAre you trying to make me fall
Youre not sorry no no oh
Fade into view oh its been a while since I have even heard from you heard from you
Were not as young but were still beautiful and free
No matter how he tries
A drunken driver missed an over pass
Like were made of starlight
I hope you think that little black dress
Hey
I dont need you dont need you
Always been a dreamer
And its too late for you and your white horse
Come on come on
Breathe without you
All the girls in the front row scream your name
Or its gonna go down in flames
Dont you dare look out your window darling
Wake up and smell the breakup
Loves a little messy and you are too
He still hasnt called
And theyre all standing around me singing
Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
Id go back to December turn around and change my own mind
When we said forever and always
Well Id rather you be mean
Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he wont seeI dont know what I want so dont ask me
And all I see is youLet me know hows it feel
And its coming over you like its all a big mistake
Where were you Where were you
Give you the benefit of the doubt every single time
When he plays a song it brings along
Forget what im trying to say oh
And tell me did Venus blow your mind
Standing in a nice dress
And you can tell me that youre sorry
In wonderland
Youre gonna believe them
Cant help it if theres no one else
But I couldnt find wings
First date cant wait
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Take that innocent heart
Just another picture to burn
Had me in the palm of your hand
When youre young you just run
You thinking you and mejust met
You were all I wanted
Tell me
Youre not sorry no no ohHe is sensible and so incredible
To cross above my head
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
That dont do something for me
Could be so mean
Ooh ooh hes talking crazy
When you feel the world is crashing
And pray for a miracle
Cant believe what it cost me
Please dont leave tonight
It was good never looking down
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
Its been waiting for you
That wasnt how it was supposed to be with me and you
Or with a nasty scar
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved
All you had to do was stay
And then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind
Youve got a girl at home
But did you ever let go
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Come on show me how much better you are so much better yeah
Heartbeats under coats
I dont know if you know who you are until you lose who you areI walked through the door with you the air was cold
In wonderland
Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
Its how you get the girl girl
If thats what you need
I need you now
X is the shape I drew through your face
I wanna be your left hand man
What do you say
But the time is ticking
Dreaming of you baby
Back up baby back up
He was lying when he said he moved to LA
So I cross my heart and hope for you
All you had to do was stay
And talk to someone I dont know
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
Tell myself its time now gotta let go
Now we got problems
Or were you someones best friend
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Will it be filled with hope and desire
I could go back to every laugh
A long time ago
I know this shouldnt be a lonely time
Pauses then says
You made us proud you made us proud proud
Spinning me around
Stardom pushed across the line
I wont let nobody hurt you wont let no one break your heart
Talking bout your daddys farm
Count them as you find a day new
Whos really bad at lying
Youd be here by now
Couldve sworn you said you loved me
And I dont try to hide my tears
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Sometimes I wait to answer
You belong with me
Bandaids dont fix bullet holes
And baby its no mystery why I surrender
When your birthday passed and I didnt call
I thought was a star
Is touch and go
The more I think about it now the less I know
Baby this is what we do
Its never too late to get it backYou and I walk a fragile line
And there he goes so perfectly
Not before I knew how much I had to lose
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Hey did some prima donna love you
I just drive on by just south of knowing why
All I know is a simple name
Sweeter than fictionIt was something like a perfect start to
Cause the players gonna play play play play play
I sat down and cried
And the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake and fake and fake and fake
Now I only want
A million things
You told me you loved me
We never go out of style
And Im back for the first time since then
Shes been in and out of hospital
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks cheeks
After all it was a great big world
And as I let you go
So close your eyes escape this town for a little while
It wont be anything like anything like
Did you forget everything
And everybody knows that
Permanent marker
Your eyeswider than distance
You say Hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
Ill be here today and here tomorrow
I guess heard you wrong
Ill keep writing songs about you
See me cry
By the way
Oh my God look at that face
My hearts still breaking
Good girls hopeful theyll be and long they will wait
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
Cause baby now we got bad blood
I have an excellent father
Who never really wanted fame
I would wait forever and ever
I tried to take the road less traveled by
I just wanna show you
And it ran over your foot
Never imagined wed end like this
Did you have to hit me where Im weak Baby I couldnt breathe
That Im not a princess this aint a fairy tale
And I remember that fight
Run your hands through your hair
I wish we could go back
I I I shake it off I shake it off
We dont have to do things their way
I gotta have youI bet this time of night youre still up
Got em up to there
And now Im pacing back and forth
She thinks about it
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Busy streets and busy lives
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And I just think you should think you should know
Oh all you had to do was stay
Stay beautiful
And put a wreath up on your door
These are the words I held back
You still look amazing
And I wait around that old wishing well
Jump then fall
I dont need dont need you
It all comes out
Heard before
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
Shes an actress whoa
And lost and thrown away
Why dont you cash in your chips
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Tossing turning struggled through the night with someone new
Dont say I didnt say I didnt warn ya
You cant feel nothing at all
We were babies we were beautiful and free
Ooh you called me up again tonight
Today was a fairytale
He smiled and I smiled well the cameras in your mind
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
I told you im not bulletproof
We were 17 and crazy running wild wild
But we got bills to pay
Every single time I come on this show
Skies grew darker currents swept you out again
Shell turn the music on you you wont have to think twice
I dont have a when and I dont have a where
Four blue eyes
All I know is you held the door
And I could go on and on on and on
I can only love you
Blowing though a valley
Your eyes how to know to look right through me
And now that I cant put this down
So let me say it real slow
Its been waiting for you
Living for the greater
Today was a fairytale
And baby now we got bad blood hey
My god if I could only say
Its been waiting for you
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
Nobody ever lets me in
Jump then fall into me into me yeahUntouchable like a distant diamond sky Mmmm
And thankin God that you werent here
I was walking up
And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
That was my SNL monologueI know weve got a lot to say
While having coffee all alone and Lord it took me away
And I thought it was a star
Screaming crying perfect storms
Im coming off a little shy
In through the window I see her with you
I thought I had you figured out
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
To be messed with
You better run
You know it used to be mad love
And I wait around that old wishing well
Hes so bad but he does it so well
Soon shes gonna find
We found wonderland
I aint ever been one to settle like
So shame on me now
And baby all I see is you
Then fall back together back together
Cause you cant lead me down that road
And the tractor rides
I knew I wasnt gonna take this very well
Today was a fairytale
Now I only smile
It dont make sense to me but
And Im so scared of how this ends
Eyes EyesBeautiful eyesAll is quiet in the world tonight
I wish that I could touch
All around your feet
And when I got home  fore I said amen
You said Ill never leave you alone
Im sorry eh eh
Then you took me by surprise
REVENGE My list of things to do this week
I never talked about the tears I cried
Dont you look in my eyes
Baby were the new romantics
Cause were young and were reckless
So hey lets be friends
Let me see your
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Thats where Im headed right now
Im captivated by you baby like a firework show
Wont you come back to me
Youd be with me so baby
Its hard to make a conversation
And I dont know
Dont look at me
Then whyd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Youre the King baby Im your Queen
Im gonna start all over again
You tell me that you want me then push me around
Somethings gone terribly wrong
So how can I ever try to be better
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
You liked the face but you had to replace me
In wonderland
I go back to December all the time
they say I need to see all the people out there waiting
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
But I do
Dont wait or say a single vow
Just close your eyes
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land
Buttons on a coat
I wonder til Im wide awake
Be my mirror my sword and shield
Oh mandolinMe and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Was that little girls smile
Every time Im on this show
Hope you know this aint easy easy for me
Counting all the scars you made
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Everybodys waiting for you to break down
Ooh I knew
Hey yeah baby how about you
Cause you know I love the players
But Im not picking up
But they dont give me choices
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
And I say
While I stay at home
Before I had somewhere to be
So I drive home alone
And it rains in your bedroom
Cause for a moment a band of thieves
Time wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it
Youre a redneck heartbreak
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
I go to work work all day
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Today was a fairytale
They say Ive always known
Well theyre beautiful
But this love is ours
I was riding shotgun
Today was a fairytale
And I realize the blame is on me
So dont you look in my eyes
Your precious heart
I lose myself in a daydream
But there was one thing missing
Christ our savior is born
Im on my guard for the rest of the world
Baby I miss you and I swear Im gonna change trust me
Say that well be together
Slipped when you started running
Like I did before
Tonights the night when we forget about the deadlines
After everything and that little black dress
American boy raising little babies
Go save the world Ill be around
La la la la la la la
But there were strangers watching
Without me without me without me
Its a run around the world
Shes precocious
You say well never make my parents mistakes
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
You caught me with that old smile
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
And it rains when youre gone
And I wrote down our songFriday night beneath the stars
And I stare at the phone
Whos that guy who plays the mandolin mandolin
Whos getting by from their applause
And look up smiling at you
So they could cut her down
Hey
Its like we dont remember
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
Nothings shatterproof
But I would lay my armor down
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything yeah
Like a diamond ring
Crazy and a little rough
Its ever changing
I know this time is like its never been before
She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs shes got Bette Davis eyes
Slow down I know that
Ill meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door
Til you open the door
Hes got his local crowd tonight
I cant resist
Unsure of turning you away
Oh
Like you always do
The night goes dark
Thinking bout the whole thing
Getting swept away
Do it or fake it
Wanted something more
We never go out of style
Id like to be my old self again but Im still trying to find it
Romeo save me Ive been feeling so alone
Cory finds another way to be
Eh
Ive never been anywhere cold as you
As Im looking around the room
Say youll remember me
And I didnt know if you knew
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
Throwing pennies at the fountain
Youre my best friend
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
I thought it was a star
Whenever youre around
But youre quicksand
My hearts still breaking
And Im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me yeah
She got up again
Only sound only sound that you hear is No
And Ill be loving you for quite some time
Today is never too late to be brand new
Hey
Did I say something way too honest
I wont pick up the phone
Please dont be in love with someone else
And stars collide in the air so light
And Id rather take a blow
Everything is wrong
Well pick up where we left off
This love is difficult but its real
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me its just wrong enough to make it feel right
James T Johnson
When you think Tim McGraw
Oh oh oh
That this is really happening
And lead me on forever
just know were miles from a heartbreak
And all the young things line up to take your place
And there in the bathroom
He respects my space
But somehow I know I
Shell tease you shell unease you
You didnt mean it baby
I know you were on my side
They are the hunters we are the foxes
So he could be home that night
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Hes better than I am
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
I hope you think of me
And the organ starts to play
So shame on me now
Just watched Stephen run across the field
We are never ever ever getting back together
It all seems so simple
I never would have played so nonchalant
I was all caught up
Sat on the floor
And Emily  shes fading fast
Tearing up a good July
By the time I woke I was singing
And he said
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Love is a ruthless game
I dont know how to be something you miss
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
Well it couldve been easy
Youll never leave me
Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And you should see her
When everythings gonna go just right
In your wildest dreams ahha ohh
Just you and me
And youre thinking well be fine again
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Your eyeswider than distance
Remember what you put me through
the greatest living hero that ever was
Hey Remember when you tried to write me off
We are alone just you and me
You told me I was pretty
And I hope sometimes you wonder about meI remember when we broke up the first time
So overnight you look like a sixties queen
Everybody knows that
There is nothing I do better than revenge
But baby never mind
Yeah here I am an open book
I will say I knew it all along
I came out alive but im black and blueue
I wont tell my friend
But in a box beneath my bed
If you keep me next to you
All this time how could you not know baby
I really do believe in you
Was as never meant to be caged in
I know you cant see me here
Unsure of turning you away
