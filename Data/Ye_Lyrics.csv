People say dont say this dont say that
King of the kingdom
Somewhere far along this road
Get money Money money money

So its only right that I let the top drop on a droptop Porsche
Man I promise shes so selfconscious
Let the sun come out and all the children say

Gone for eternity
Livin the life til I die

Kites off to jails buying sweats running up in Stetson
But its too late its too late hes gone
From the concrete grew a rose

Rolly G police watch me smoke my weed count my Gs
And Im the little kid tryna touch the exhibits

Middle finger in the air if you dont really care

Back in the hood its a different type of chemical
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
Im new in the city but Im down for the night
When I kicked a flow it was like pickandroll
You see a player flicking and how you aint convinced
Ball on them niggas get heated and shot down
The clouds is in my vision look how high that I be getting
In the mall till 12 when my schedule had said 9
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
Its bad enough I got all this jewelry on

Caught with a trunk of Barry Manilows
Who will survive in America

When I go raw I like to leave it in
Never over…Never over… Never over… Never over…

To real friends til the reel end
K I need a free hand mammogram

Life movin too fast I need to slow down
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
Wrote this song just so you know
And I aint sayin we was from the projects
Just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
Music and iPhone cameras
All my fault to be a real boy chasin the American dream
High lights
If my manager insults me again
Father Father Father in the night sky
When you stop the programs for after school
Better we can make it on up we can
And the white man get paid off of all of that
Do you think about me now and then
And that haunted me all the way home
I gotta get with it Ooh ooh oooh
Use this gospel for protection
One hand in the air if you dont really care
You know just what we want
Yeah you see em look
I gotta say at that time Id like to meet Kanye
Oh oh oh oh
Sing til the power of the Lord comes down Sing til the power of the Lord falls down
Come up in the spot lookin extra fly
And I I wouldnt last these shows
Hands on yeah hands on
Memories made in the coldest winter
I cant control it I cant hold it its so nuts
Well easy come easy go how that saying goes
But he just cant seem to get Kanye fresh
Im tellin you all it all falls down
You never know homie about these hoes homie
Sing til the power of the Lord comes down Let us sing let us sing oh sing
Now tell everybody that you know that you know
Damn here we go again
I cant study no yeah my
Every tongue confess

Everybody feel a way about K but at least yall feel something
Get to rubbin on my lamp
Grab a drink grab a glass
Real friends
The only thing I wish I wish a nigga would Welcome to the good life
And on and and on and on and on
Let me crash here for a moment
Bam ey ey ey
Came to see me in my black skin Black
We dont want no devils in the house God Yes Lord
Man Jay they dont really want no problems
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Im coming after whoever who has it
I tell you that all is my weight and gold
The clocks ticking I just count the hours
All of the lights she was caught in the hype girl
More than ever hour after—
But you really just know the old me
See I done did all this ol bullshit
Hey Mama
Colors drippin off
Its just the memories that you have
If I ever wasnt the greatest nigga I must have missed it
Baby girl tryna get a nut
Comin’ from inside the screen you a wild bitch
Im on the edge so why you playing Im saying
You never used to talk dirty but now you God damn disgusting
Cause we were once a fairy tale
You just popped in the Kanye West
I just wanted you to know
I gotta testify
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
We wont stop everybody move
Cause I aint got the money on me right now
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
I take a sip of that gnac I wanna fuck
Now its Dennys 4 in the morning spoil your appetite
Puttin them pants on shelves waitin patiently I ask myself
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
Thank you God bless you good night I came I came I came
I aint scared to lose a fistfight Turn me up
I cant study no yeah my
Can we get much higher
I think I was made for that
Try and make it to the party fore the guest list close
No cant stop having these visions
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Thats why shortys hollerin Where the ballers at
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
Put one up in the sky
Hey Mama
This is the elite
It feel like NY summertime Chi
So let me get this straight wait Im the rookie

And Im back on my grind
She on a diet but my pockets eating cheesecake
Cant stop having these visions
I wanna scream so loud for you cause Im so proud of you
But dont worry this ones so jammin
Understand understand understand Im standin under oath
Therefore G4s at the Clearport
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
Nothings ever promised tomorrow today Nothings ever promised tomorrow today

How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes
Live as a red Jag a Louis bag grabbing a blunt fuck it
Baby I got a plan run away as fast as you can
Time to take it too far now
We wasnt supposed to make it past 25
I need every bad bitch up in Equinox
You got the official wave man
Things we see on the screen thats not ours
Oh Rosie brings the sunshine oh
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Come up in the spot lookin extra fly
They been strategizin to harm me
Oh deep inside
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
I pray your bodys draped more like mine

Question What do these things all have in common
Only thing I ask is next time Im on stage we all go
Good dude bad night right place wrong time

Racisms still alive they just be concealin it

Im making love to the angel of death
Blac Chyna fuckin Rob help him with the weight
I wont always be crying tears
Youre the only power Power
Nigga do we have a problem
The powers that be done been greedy
We gonna through too much bullshit just to mess with these drunk and hot girls
So I roll through good
With the girls a lot of flirtin involved but dog
Way down way down
Take the chlorine out our conversation
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Thats on LA Reid thats on Clive
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
Oh oh oh ohoh oh oh
Im a problem
Sky sky high I’m I’m sky high
Broke broke broke phi broke we aint got it
Turn up the lights in here baby
Big family small house no room
The leaves’ll be green bearing the fruit
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
You too wild you too wild
Niggas hats broke off thats how we grow up
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Cause when I die buddy
I keep it 300 like the Romans
Red white blue black Throw your hands up
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
Cause The good life I always had a passion for flashin
You know it LA its so jammin
When you a dick with a loose nut
Hand em
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
You know the best medicine go to people thats paid
I feel it fadin
Wonder if its a plan that the master devised
I know you see me I know you see me
Fakeass facade that they couldnt keep up
Kanye its Foxx man
Yknow he had I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Hey you remember where we first met
To my family thank you for holding me down
Used to but still got love
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin
Walk all over me
And we about to let it floooooow oh oh
Revolution aint a game its another name for life fightin
Aint nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
At the end of it you know we both were wrong
I was high when I met her
Too close to snipe you truth told I like you
Cant let them get to me
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
Built the Roc from a pebble peddled rock before I met you
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
Im tryna keep my faith
Niggas thinkin Im crazy you defendin me
Its a celebration bitches
We aint retards the way teachers thought

You cant blame em they aint never seen Versace sofas
Mama used to cook red beans and rice

Got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Most imitated Grammy nominated

If ya iced up pull ya sleeves out
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laughed
Last month I helped her with the car payment

Come up in the spot lookin extra fly

My guy said I need a different approach
All for a chance to be a star
Right down to the wire even through the fire
She like Fuck it Ill just stay down hurr and do hair

Because that seems like a common theme
I dont know how you saying it but let em hear this
Arguing with my dad and he said It aint Christlike

My degree keeps me satisfied
Only made me more focused only wrote more potent
Time to break down all the prisons
We shine because they hate us floss cause they degrade us
Partyin SOBs and we had packed a crowd
I found you somewhere out
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
Im new in the city but Im down for the night
Cmon cmon and when it falls down
And I might see you in my nightmare
Father Father Father in the night sky
Fast life drug life thug life
Thats your best bet whys that Cons

Cause I could make it good I could make it hood
Remember that last time the episode
But right now she asleep sleep sleep
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Turned out how you thought
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
I think I think too much
Somewhere far along this road
See before I let you go
Uh thats that crack music crack music
My joy
How we out in Europe spending Euros
Now this will be a beautiful death
Why would she make calls out the blue
Did it with no permission on our own conditions
Now where the West Side
And I get bleach on my Tshirt
Whoop him after school just to show I got class
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
Breaking up We can make it better
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I think Im possessed its an omen
He wanna play it again like he got somethin else to do
I just talked to Jesus
No more Los Angeles
While to you Im just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Caught between space and time
My presence is a present kiss my ass
Lets play the blame game
Yeezus just rose again
What a bam
Yall got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
Pretending hes with us hes not one of us
That go into that all that money that the court got
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
Ill fly away
Top five MCs you aint gotta remind me
I keep it 300 like the Romans
They say that they dont see what you see in me
Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
Work it harder make it better
Pour the lean out slower
You know domestic drama and shit all the attitude
Yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
Lets slow it down like were on the syrup
The preacher said we need leaders
It was all part of the story even the scary nights

By broke brothas in the 20s years ago
You wait a couple of months then you gon see

And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
From the very start

Told the devil when I see him on sight
And theyll play this song on and on
1 AM and cant nobody get a hold of you
If a nigga act up pull a Desert Es out

Okay get your kids but then they got their friends
The Rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the Roc

You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
Ohoh oh oh Work work work work
Diamonds are forever forever forever
And livin all
We surrounded by the fuckin wolves
Middle finger in the air if you dont really care
And if you follow the charts or the plaques or the stacks

But Ill be gone til November I got packs to move
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Heavenll watch God calling from the hotlines
Look at ya look at ya look at ya
Im mixed now fleshed out
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
Damn them new loafers hurt my pocket
And then they make noise
I know I got angels watching me from the other side
I ordered the jerk she said you are what you eat
Might call 2Pac over

My favorite albums used to have like bonus joints like this
I believe in the children listen to the kids bro
Only halfway read Ephesians
Hands up we just doing what the cops taught us

Life is much more than runnin in the streets
When I thought the Book of Job was a job

She went to the doctor got lipo with your money

Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Pictures of me drunk walkin out with a bitch
Writin my rhymes playin my mind
