Pour the lean out slower
Got us clean out of soda
Before the flood people judge
They did the same thing to Noah
Everybody wanted Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on Monday
But the strong start on Sunday
Wont be in bondage to any man
John 833
We the descendants of Abraham
Ye should be made free
John 836
To whom the son set free is free indeed
He saved a wretch like me

Pressin on the gas supernova for a night light
Screamin at my dad and he told me It aint Christlike
But nobody never tell you when youre being like Christ
Only ever seein me only when they needin me

Make you feel alone in the dark and youll never see the light
Man youre never seein home and you never see the domes
I can feel it when I write point of livin in the right
If they only see the wrongs never listen to the songs
Just to listen is a fight but you booked me for the fight

From the love of religion
What have you been hearin from the Christians
Theyll be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me

In the Father we put our faith
King of the kingdom
Our demons are tremblin
Holy angels defendin
In the Father we put our faith
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohoh oh oh
How could He not be the greatest
In my bed under covers when undercovers had raided
My presence is happy belated
Fashionably late Im just glad that you made it
The best is yet to come Im just glad that you waited
They all say they real til its time to appraise it
I seen them come and go you only the latest
But who am I to judge Im crooked as Vegas
Use this gospel for protection
Its a hard road to Heaven
We call on Your blessings
In the Father we put our faith
King of the kingdom
Our demons are tremblin
Holy angels defendin
In the Father we put our faith
A lot of damaged souls I done damaged those
And in my arrogance took a camera pose
Caught with a trunk of Barry Manilows
They sing a different tune when the slammer close
From the concrete grew a rose
They give you Wraith talk I give you faith talk
Blindfolded on this road watch me faith walk
Just hold on to your brother when his faith lost
Oh oh oh Work work work work
Oh oh oh Work work work work
Oh oh oh Work work work work
Ohoh oh oh Work work work work

Nowhere seems to be too far

No more Los Angeles
Please Shake that body party that bod

Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spraytan
It was more than soft porn for the KMan
She remember my Sprinter said I was in the grape van
Uhm—well cutie I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badume—well lets make a movie
Hell you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now its Dennys 4 in the morning spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction middle finger pedestrians
RB singers and lesbians rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you its damaging for you I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math
That shit dont add up youre making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an Alist rapper
I said baby Spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
Youre dealing with malpractice dont kill a good niggas confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you dont know what a condom is
The head still good though the head still good though
Make me say Nam Myoho Renge Kyo
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Capn Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service head service I came in first place
The opportunity the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released she was kickin in gratuity
And yeah G I was all for it
She said KLamar you kinda dumb to be a poet
Ima put you on game for the lames that dont know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy
Scary scary
No more parties in LA
Please baby no more parties in LA
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds passenger seat—somethin pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Secondclass bitches wouldnt let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become Alist I wasnt even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs somebody gon get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks man you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinskyd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I cant fault em really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens she aint goin back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin
Of weak content and slow jammin
But dont worry this ones so jammin
You know it LA its so jammin
I be thinkin every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time the pressure
The problem aint I be drivin the problem is I be textin
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was bout their friend that just died
Textin and drivin down Mulholland Drive
Thats why Id rather take the 405
I be worried bout my daughter I be worried bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye I aint worried bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What Im supposed to do
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints
Every agent I know know I hate agents
Im too black Im too vocal Im too flagrant
Something smellin like shit thats the new fragrance
Its just me I do it my way bitch
Some days Im in my Yeezys some days Im in my Vans
If I knew yall made plans I wouldnt have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldnt rap like this again
But the writers block is over emcees cancel your plans
A 38yearold 8yearold with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I dont never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn Got a bald fade I might slam
Pink fur got Nori dressin like Cam
Thank God for me Los Angeles
Whole family gettin money thank God for E
I love rockin jewelry a whole neckful
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when Im workin on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when Im workin on my house
Tell em partys in here we dont need to go out
We need the turbo thots high speed turbo thots
Dropdrodrodrodrop like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach good dickll do that
She keep pushin me back good dickll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dickll put your ass to sleep
Get money Money money money
Big big money Money money money

My wife said I cant say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin Im in debt
And like my wife said I still didnt say no
People tryna say Im goin crazy on Twitter
My friends best advice was to stay low
I guess its hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin
The media said hes way out of control
I just feel like Im the only one not pretendin
Im not out of control Im just not in they control
I know Im the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generations closest thing to Einstein
So dont worry about me Im fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought dont need to question
I know its antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra he down with the mission
Did it with no permission on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Dont stare at money too long its Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasnt supposed to make it past 25

I believe in the children listen to the kids bro
If the phone ringin go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldnt balance a checkbook
But buy a new car talkin bout How my neck look
Well it all looks great
Four hundred years later we buyin our own chains
The light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets your salary
I am one with the people
I am one with the people Real
Ive been woken from enlightened mans dream
Checkin Instagram comments to crowdsource my selfesteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if Im up way too much Im out of touch
Im prayin a outofbody experience will happen
So the people can see my light now its not just rappin
God I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know I know He got a plan I know Im on Your beams
One set of footsteps You was carryin me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin me
One set of footsteps You was carryin me
When I was negotiatin with Apple it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me I was scary to see
I wouldve took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard its the way they did it when we only had a stove
But its better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then Ima never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time Im on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself lookin for niggas like wheres Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped em at Aldo
Modernday MJ with a offthewall flow
Nightlife walk all over me

Im deliverin everything Ive ever sent that youll bring
Fly fly fly overseas
Fly overseas

Youve been treatin me like Im invisible now Im visible to you
Oh the invisible truths they sold
I cant quite understand the games you play
Understand understand understand Im standin under oath
And I promised I I wouldnt fall anymore
But Im cryin at the bar
Im wishin that you saw my scars man
Im wishin that you came down here and stood by me
And looked at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I dont know anyone except the night sky above
Yeah youre lookin at the church in the night sky

Beyond the truest hey teacher teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students
And refresh the page and restart the memory
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy
We stopped the ignorance we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But whats worse the pain or the hangover
Fresh air rollin down the window
Too many Urkels on your team thats why your wins low
Dont make me pull the toys out huh
Dont make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines huh
And then they make noise
Can we get much higher So high
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
At the mall there was a seance
Just kids no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
Saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron

I will never ever let you live this down down down
Not for nothing Ive foreseen it I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down down down
Penitentiary chances the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin for the love of ballin
Got caught with 30 rocks the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Intercentury anthems based off innercity tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
This the real world homie school finished
They done stole your dreams you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I wont be satisfied til all my niggas get it get it
Aint no question if I want it I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
Im on the edge so why you playing Im saying
I will never ever let you live this down down down
Is hiphop just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as Im in Polo smiling they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldnt sack me
If a nigga aint shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the Worlds game this is my Olympics
We make em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs niggas cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasnt the greatest nigga I must have missed it
Aint no question if I want it I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
Im on the edge so why you playing Im saying
I will never ever let you live this down down down
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said Take them glasses off and get in the pool
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip set I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I dont believe in yesterday
And whats a black Beatle anyway a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like Im sniffing coke
Its not funny anymore try different jokes
Tell em hug and kiss my ass X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I aint had a belt in two classes
I aint got it Im coming after whoever who has it
Im coming after whoever who has it
You blowin up that’s good fantastic
That yall its like that yall
I dont really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me

Aint no question if I want it I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
Im on the edge so why you playing Im saying
I will never ever let you live this down down down

Armani suits fresh fruits Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up smoking one cuff
Live as a red Jag a Louis bag grabbing a blunt fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one Ls
Kites off to jails buying sweats running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes throwing dice for decimals
The older head bolder head would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field not a soldier dead
That meant code red bent off the black skunk
The black dutch back of the old shed
If you cant live you dying you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving keep grinding
Keep shining to every young man this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
Not for nothing Ive forseen it I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down down down
Im living in that 21st Century doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it

Got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
My childlike creativity purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child Im fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamondencrusted piece
Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clocks ticking I just count the hours
Stop tripping Im tripping off the powder
Til then fuck that the world’s ours
And they say and they say
And they say and they say
And they say and they say

The way you look should be a sin you my sensation
I know Im preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan
Satan Satan Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We aint married but tonight I need some consummation
When the sun go down its the magic hour the magic hour
And outta all the colors thatll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Dont leave while youre hot thats how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot at the bar take a seat
I ordered the jerk she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
Thats Dior Homme not Dior homie
The crib Scarface could it be more Tony
You love me for me Could you be more phony
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin you my sensation
Havent said a word—havent said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue
Lookin at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin at my wrist itll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine sipping rosé all alone
Doubleheaded monster with a mind of his own
Cherryred chariot excess is just my character
Allblack tux niggas shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired Ugh
Before his jaw shattered climbing up the Lords ladder
We still speeding running signs like they dont matter
Ugh hater talking never made me mad
Never that not when Im in my favorite papertag
Therefore G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool Im a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin so its on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan the Lex sport
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was getting mail from
Polk County Jacksonville rep Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the nights over
God bless the man I put the sights over
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga red Coogi sweater diceroller
Im making love to the angel of death
Catching feelings never stumble retracing my steps
Look at ya look at ya look at ya look at ya
Look at ya look at ya look at ya look at ya
Look at ya look at ya look at ya look at ya

And got married in a bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That’s one hell of a life
Mmm mmm mmm
Whose fault
Lets play the blame game I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure
Lets call out names names I hate you more
Lets call out names names for sure
Ill call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it you know we both were wrong
But I love to play the blame game I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure
Lets call out names names I hate you more
Lets call out names names for sure
On a bathroom wall I wrote
Id rather argue with you than to be with someone else
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo Id rather be by my fucking self
Till about two am and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help
Lets play the blame game I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure
Lets call out names names I hate you more
Lets call out names names for sure
You werent perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you aint getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin you
Lying say I hit you he sitting there consoling you
Runnin my name through the mud whos provoking you
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and cant nobody get control of you
1 AM and cant nobody get a hold of you
Im calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Yall got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That aint right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I aint your right girl
Youll probably find one of them I like arttype girls
All of the lights she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with a lie
Now who to blame You to blame
Me to blame For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game
Lets play the blame game I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure
Things used to be now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
Weve become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of LOVE
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Lets play the blame game I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure
Lets call out names names I hate you more
Lets call out names names for sure
I cant love you this much I cant love you this much
I cant love you this much I cant love you this much
I cant love you this much no I cant love you this much
I cant love you this much I cant love you this much
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You aint pick up but your phone accidentally called me back

Us living as we do upsidedown
And the new word to have is revolution
People dont even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because Gods whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed
To continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina
We learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom freedoom
Democracy liberty and justice were revolutionary code names
That preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
In the mother countrys crotch
What does Webster say about soul
All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children and some food to feed them every night
After all is said and done build a new route to China if theyll have you
Who will survive in America
Who will survive in America
Who will survive in America
Who will survive in America
I know you see me now right now You see me now right now

Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty’s swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin board when I am bored
All my homies GDs but I am Lord
Rap god Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here’s somethin that you could use as an analogy
My life is like a child’s illusions become reality

Do you think Id sacrifice a real life
For all the fame and flashing lights
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell and my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life what does it feel like
I ask you tonight I ask you tonight
What does it feel like I ask you tonight
To live a real life
I just wanna be a real boy
They always say Kanye he keeps it real boy
Pinocchios story is I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchios story goes to be a real boy
Its funny
Pinocchio lied and thats what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep running
Its like Im lookin for something out there tryna find something
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing
What does it feel like to live real life to be real
Not some facade on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina
For everybody that sees you that say Wheres my camera
For everybody that sees you to say Sign a autograph
For everybody that sees you cryin that say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh
I just wanna be a real boy Pinocchios story goes
I just wanna be a real boy Pinocchios story goes
And there is no Gepetto to guide me
No one right beside me
The only one was behind me
I cant find her no more I cant call her no more
I cant
The only one that come out on the tour and stays
Back when I was livin at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get got
And the day I moved to LA maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy chasin the American dream
Chasin everything we seen up on the TV screen
And when uh the Benz was left
And the clothes was left and the hoes was left
You talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the
You spend the dough to death
And tell me what be left for a real boy
They say Kanye you keep it too real boy

How many ladies in the house
If you know
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
What it means
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused

You ever wonder what it all really mean

And try to hit you with the olwuwopte

Damn here we go again
Common passed on this beat I made it to a jam
Now everything Im not made me everything I am
Damn here we go again
People talking shit but when the shit hit the fan
Everything Im not made me everything I am
Ill never be pictureperfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet He was black as the street was
Ill never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why peoplell reach a
Fakeass facade that they couldnt keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah
Ill never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like william
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything Im not made me everything I am
Damn here we go again
Everybody saying whats not for him
But everything Im not made me everything I am
Damn here we go again
People talking shit but when the shit hit the fan
Everything Im not made me everything I am
And Im back to tear it up
Haters start your engines I hear em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay fair enough the streets is flaring up
Cause they want gun talk or I dont wear enough
Baggy clothes Reeboks or Adidos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
Theyd rather give me the Nnigga Please Award
But Ill just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award
Damn here we go again
Bumtubumbumbum
But everything Im not made me everything I am
Damn here we go again
People talking shit but when the shit hit the fan
Everything Im not made me everything I am
I know people wouldnt usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year Chicago had over 600 caskets
Man killings some wack shit
Oh I forgot cept for when niggas is rappin
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody pastor
The church want tithe so I cant afford to pay
Pink slip on my door cause I cant afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up but I got more to say
Thats enough Mr West please no more today
Damn here we go again
Everybody saying whats not for him

Married to the game rock a chain steada wedding ring

How Im suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up
So yeah at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego
I can stand there in a Speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory the story the chain the polo the night
The grind the empty bottles of NoDoz
Tank on empty whipping my mammas Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes shit that you dont floss
The Goyard so hard man Im Hugos boss
Why I gotta ask what that TUDOR cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And Im asking about her girlfriends
Yeah the dark skined ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like
I know I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know BIG and Pac you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Any one Big Pun Big L or Notorious
Till then get money and stunt and stay glorious
And Im gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit

Do you think about me now and then Yeah
Do you think about me now and then
Cause Im comin home again Ow

I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me little homie I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to toe em off
And make em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep makin that keep makin that platinum and gold for me
Im comin home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Cause Im comin home again
Min home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then Oh
Now Im comin home again
Maybe we can start again
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldntve never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her it always seems like she talkin bout me
She said You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got til its gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that When I was back home
Every interview Im representin you makin you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talkin bout ChiTown
Im comin home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Cause Im comin home again
Min home again

Stadium status
My big brother was BIGs brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother who was No ID friend
No ID my mentor now let the story begin
Its the Hard Knock Life Tour sellout
Picture us in the mall coppin Iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yeah thats what well yell out yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell bout
JAY and Ye so shy
Now he wont even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind He could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
Big brother was BIGs brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother who was No ID friend
No ID my mentor now let the story begin begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why dont you wave your hands
Fresh off the plane Im off to Baseline
Nothing handed out Im bout to take mine
round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
Id play my little songs in that old back room
Hed bob his head and say Damn Oh thats you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Partyin SOBs and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And Im like Yeah yeah we gon be there but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin a little different
And kept little brother at bay at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now Im on the top and everybody on the scrotum
My big brother was BIGs brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother who was No ID friend
No ID my mentor now let the story begin begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why dont you wave your hands
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client the Presidito hola Hovito
The game gettin foul so heres a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now Im on the steeple
And we know New Jack City—got to keep my brother
But to be number one Ima beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pickandroll
Cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind Im like Damn no way
Translate español No way José
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
My big brother was BIGs brother
So heres a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on head tell em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell em
A idol in my eyes god of the game
Heart of the City RocaFella chain
Never be the same never be another
Number one Young Hov also my big brother
My big brother was BIGs brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother who was No ID friend
No ID my mentor and thats where the story ends
Toomp killed this shit
Im not sure anymore more
Who is knocking at my door door
All the faces that I know
Ja make them so sunny and true
I dont wanna say goodbye to you
So Ill just say good night to you
My people no goodbyes to you
Im just gon say good night
Uh
Good night
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trip
And Im the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But itll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told Id know to laugh
Man man I wouldnt let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you dont really know cause you cant recall them
Its sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life real life if you try to
So close so close but so far but so far
And so far and so far no cigar no cigar
We cant dwell on the past all we got is today
So Ima live like its no tomorrow no goodbyes
I dont wanna say goodbye to you
So Ill just say good night to you
My people no goodbyes to you
Im just gon say good night
Uh to you
If I part my art will live through you

Wake up like every day new to you
Stay true to you a hood musical
I dont wanna say goodbye to you

Bittersweet
Youre gonna be the death of me
I dont want you but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet
See what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before thats what the virgin says
Weve been generally warned thats what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency
And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
Id never do that to you at least purposely
We breaking up again we making up again
But we dont love no more I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights yall have a bad fight
And you talk about her family her aunts and shit
And she say Motherfucker your mommas a bitch
You know domestic drama and shit all the attitude
Id never hit a girl but Ill shake the shit out of you
But Imma be the bigger man big pimpin like Jigga man
Oh I guess I figure its
Bittersweet
Youre gonna be the death of me
I dont want you but I need you
I love you hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet
See what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before thats what the virgin says
Weve been generally warned thats what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency
And my niggas said I shouldnt let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking
And this relationship it even got me back to drinking
Now this Hennessy uh its gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I cant even vibe with you sexually
Cause every time that Id try you would question me
Saying You fucking them girls disrespecting me
You dont see how your lies is affecting me
You dont see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you aint cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone you always be where them hoes will be
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
Bittersweet I fucked up and I know it G
Youre gonna be the death of me I guess its bittersweet poetry
I dont want you but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet
Youre gonna be the death of me
I dont want you but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
See what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before thats what the virgin says
Weve been generally warned thats what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency
See what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before thats what the virgin says
Weve been generally warned thats what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency
Bittersweet

Kanye niggais you snorin in my class
Wake up Mr West
Wake up Mr West  Mr West  Mr West
Uh yea uh yea uh yea
And I heard em say nothings ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi like Tim its a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
Things we see on the screen thats not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where Im from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they cant cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars  I know it
Uh and I heard em say Ooh nothings ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard em say
Nothings ever promised tomorrow today Nothings ever promised tomorrow today
But well a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus and one day that you see him
Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam cant put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I cant figure it out Im sick of it now
Uh and I heard em say Ooh nothings ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard em say
Nothings ever promised tomorrow today Nothings ever promised tomorrow today
But well a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
With every worthless word we get more far away
And nothings ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
Oohh Oohh Oohh Oohh
Uh yea uh yea uh yea

We are sharin jeans
If I go outside I got the only clothing on
How many cars do we own None
How many cars do we own None sir
Should we let our woman go and be with the cat with the car
Yes we will
Why Because we cant afford gas Say it with me
We cant afford no gas
Say it
We cant afford no gas
So we aint drivin
Drive slow homie
Drive slow homie
You never know homie about these hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie
My homie Mali used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me KRock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know hes the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers even more by polices
Howd he get the cash The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil somethin sixteen he was stuntin
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout eighty
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See backback thenthen if you had a car
You was the ChiTown version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
Wed take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras we was hurtin em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin involved but dog
Fuck all that flirtin now Im tryin to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes homie
He told me dont rush to get grown drive slow homie
Drive slow homie
Drive slow
You never know homie about these hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie
What it do Im posted up in the parking lot my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate its simply amazing
Them elbows pokin wide on that candy Lac
Trunk open screens on neons lit with fifth relaxed
Im on a mission for dimepieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
Its a starstudded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling You see them screens falling
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates Im ballin
Im leaning on the switch sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin something candycoated crawling like a caterpillar
Im tipping on them fours Im jamming on that Screw
Im looking for them hoes baby what it do Drive slow homie
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow homie
If youre riding around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow homie
Live today cause tomorrow man you never know
You never know homie might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie
My cars like the movie my cars like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that dont make no sense but baby Im the shit
And everything I flip you know its something serious
I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby this evidence
You see a player flicking and how you aint convinced
That you should go on and kiss it just a lil bit just a lil bit
I got my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin through my angel wings
They see me hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak Im ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet like tiptoes
I sold Os and this I know
When you see them hoes lil homie drive slow
drive slow drive slow
Yeah
Drive slow homie
Drive slow homie
You never know homie might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie
Drive slow homie
Yeah
They say home is where the hate is my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin chains divided only hustle remains
Makin sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution aint a game its another name for life fightin
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin for hits to heighten they hell
Dont he know he could only get as high as he fell
Show money becomes bail relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale Behold the Pale  Horse
Got me trapped like R Kel I bail and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again
Im on my way home
I left three days ago but no one seems to know Im gone
Home is where the hatred is home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again

How we stop the Black Panthers
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that What Gil Scott was hearin
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland
We invested in that its like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it cut it measure it bag it
Sell it the fiends cop it nowadays they cant tell if

From the place where the fathers gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the Madigans lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say we just tryin to party holmes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood its a different type of chemical
Arm  Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers ran for the stove cause
Cause dreams of being Hova
Went from bein a broke man to bein a dopeman
To bein the President look theres hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you round that—
Crack music nigga

Our Father give us this day our daily bread
Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ol bullshit
And to atone I throw a lil somethin somethin on the pulpit
We took that shit measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mommas aint got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gon repo everything they ever took from granny
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys
This dark diction has become Americas addiction
Those who aint even black use it
We gon keep baggin up this here crack music
I know its past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers
The doctor dont wanna take procedures
He claim her heart cant take the anaesthesia
Itll send her body into a seizure
That lil thing by the hospital bed itll stop beepin
Hey chick Im at a loss for words
What do you say at this time Remember when I was 9
Tell her everything gon be fine but I be lyin
Her family cryin they want her to live and she tryin
Im arguin like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people thats paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandmas in the NBA
Right now shed be okay But since she
Was just a secretary worked for the church for 35 years
Things sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin to pull it together hes strong
Thats where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse Did you do the research
She asked me Can you sign some tshirts
Bitch is you smokin reefer
You dont see that we hurt But still
I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I cant wait for a sunny day seeing it through your eyes
Cant wait for the clouds to break
They outside of the emergency room room
You can feel my heartbeat beat beat
If she gon pull through we gon find out soon
But right now she asleep sleep sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick what these doctors know anyway
Let me see the Xrays I aint no expert Im just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley Aunt Beverly Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie its just One Thing
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a alltime high
To get there we run we fly we drive
Cause with my family we know where home is
And so instead of sending flowers we the roses
I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I cant wait for a sunny day seeing it through your eyes
Cant wait for the clouds to break
Oh Rosie brings the sunshine oh
I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I cant wait for a sunny day seeing it through your eyes
Cant wait for the clouds to break
I smile when Rosie come to see me
And Im sad when Rosie goes away
Oh Rosie brings the sunshine say
Cant wait I cant wait no
Cant wait I cant wait no
Cant wait I cant wait
No cant wait for for a sunny day
Momma cant wait for the clouds to break
Mm mmm mm mmmm mmmm
Oh oh oh oh no no say

Way down way down
One day theyd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day theyd try to bring me down
Way down theyd try to bring me down
We gon to Mass today we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers dont even deserve a track from me
You see if you ever wanted to ever be anything
Thered always be somebody that shoot down any dream
Therell always be haters thats the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon have to take my life fore they take my drive
Cause when I was barely livin thats what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind fore Im out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl dont like me how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say Yo no hablo inglés
And everybody want to run to me for their single
Its funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasnt around when I couldnt feed myself
Dawg if I was you I wouldnt feel myself
Dawg if I was you Id kill myself
Made a mil myself and Im still myself
And Imma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now Ill speak from the heart yall all frontin
Everybody feel a way about K but at least yall feel something
What you calling
I let all in for getting what some get will get ya
What kind of dream we found
See Im often catching crosswinds
Forgetting where the hell I met you
And try to bring me down
I always knew that one day theyd try to bring me down
Way down way down
One day theyd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day theyd try to bring me down
Way down theyd try to bring me down

Diamonds are forever
Theyre all I need to please me
They cant stimulate or tease me
They wont leave in the night
Have no fear that they might desert me
Diamonds are forever forever forever
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever Forever ever Ever ever
Ever ever Ever ever Ever ever Ever ever
Good mornin this aint Vietnam still
People lose hands legs arms for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I aint talkin about the ones that be glowin
Im talkin about RocaFella my home
My chain these aint conflict diamonds
Is they Jacob Dont lie to me man
See a part of me sayin keep shinin
How when I know what a blood diamond is
Though its thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here its a drug trade we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds the chains the bracelets the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And heres the conflict
Its in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryin to get that ice
On a Polo rugby it looks so nice
How can somethin so wrong make me feel so right
Right Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your RocaFella diamond tonight cause
Diamonds are forever forever forever
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever Forever ever Ever ever
Ever ever Ever ever Ever ever Ever ever
People askin me is Im gon give my chain back
Thatll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dawg Yo where Dame at
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back
Whats up with you and Jay man Are yall okay man
Yup I got it from here Ye damn
The chain remains the gang is intact
The name is mine Ill take blame for that
The pressures on but guess who aint gonna crack
Ha ha pardon me I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when youre the Rock of Gibraltar
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This aint no tall order this is nothin to me
Difficult takes a day impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke Im guessin I can sell CDs
Im not a businessman Im a business man
Let me handle my business damn
Kanyeez you got me Freeway then Foxy
YGs Teairra Mari Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as Im alive hes a millionaire
And even if I die hes in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah he dont even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money last three lifetimes
Shirley Basseys in the rear
Sayin exactly what Ive been sayin practically my whole career
The diamond is forever Ive been minin this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Dons timin couldnt be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If youre waitin for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time
Im Young bitches Good night

And watch how we roll up and
I cant control it I cant hold it its so nuts

Better than a chick that say Yes too soon
Until you have a daughter thats what I call karma
And you pray to God she dont grow breasts too soon
Projects tore up gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off thats how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes Just to blow up
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He aint never had shit but he had that nine
Nigga come through flicking and he had that shine
Put two and two together and a little bad weather
Gon be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend Was the strip clubs cool

First line—should it be about the hoes or the ice
Fourfours or Black Christ Both flowsd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like Should I freestyle or write
He said Nas what the fans want is Illmatic still
Looked at the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now Im a free agent and Im thinking its time
To build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived of executive ninetofives
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So yall copped the LPs and yall fiends got dealt
Im Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasted longer than more than half of you clowns
Look I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke

Late December harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup can I have another bowl
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove but didnt give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy cant you see
Seven years old caught you with tears in your eyes
Cause a nigga cheatin telling you lies then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy Ima love you til you dont hurt no more
And when Im older you aint gotta work no more
And Ima get you that mansion that we couldnt afford
See youre unbreakable unmistakable
Highly capable lady thats makin loot
A livin legend too just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel and I thank you Hey Mama
Hey Mama
I wanna scream so loud for you cause Im so proud of you
Let me tell you what Im about to do
Hey Mama
I know I act a fool but I promise you Im goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me

Hey Mama
Forrest Gump mama said Life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like its things I gotta get
Things I gotta do just to prove to you
You was getting through can the choir please
Give me a verse of You Are So Beautiful To Me
Cant you see youre like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou Nikki Giovanni turn one page and theres my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey yall say Mama now everybody answer me Hey Mama
Hey Mama
I wanna scream so loud for you cause Im so proud of you

Hey Mama

Second they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows ride around the city and let ya friends know Hey Mama
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
To a restaurant upper echelon
Ima get you a Jag whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of SType Donda West like
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It dont gotta be Mothers Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say Hey Mama
I wanna scream so loud for you cause Im so proud of you
Let me tell you what Im about to do
Hey Mama

Dag niggas still doing puffpuffpass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell em

An old man just gon tell em too late
Then I see how yall gonna react when Im gone
My last girl want me back then Im on
Fine stay you got the grind hey
Came back read what the sign say
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy acting like a thief in disguise
Ain’t even my size see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby I hustle brought weed to the Chi shit
And that aint even a lie please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now
We striving home I ride on chrome
Listen homeboy move on
Thats your best bet whys that Cons
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pals gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess its only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what couldve gone wrong
Now they asking Cons how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now I shouldve gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind cause Ida gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times cause Im gone
Uhuhuh uhuhuh uh uh onnn uh uhuh onnn
Uhuh onnn uh uhuh
Im ahead of my time sometimes years out
So the powers that be wont let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunts house
Yeah I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1999
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me Benz or Rover
Man if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheapass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteenyearold
Sell drugs or get a job you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell hooked us up plural
Fired a week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I cant believe it when I look up in the mirro
How we out in Europe spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got til its gone
I know I got it I dont know what yall on
Ima open up a store for aspiring MCs
Wont sell em no dream but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
Youll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on Ill handle it dont start panickin stay calm
Shorties at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life they souls and they songs
They said Sorry Mr West is gone
Diamonds are forever
They wont leave in the night
Ive no fear that they might
Desert me
Diamonds are forever forever forever
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever Forever ever Ever ever Ever ever
Ever ever Ever ever Ever ever
Close your eyes and imagine feel the magic
Vegas on acid seen through Yves St Laurent glasses
And Ive realized that Ive arrived
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes Well sort of I think em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn is he really that caught up
I ask if you talkin about classics do my name get brought up
I remember I couldnt afford a Ford Escort
Or even a fourtrack recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a droptop Porsche
Spoil yourself thats important
If your stripper name Porsche and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me thats just the Henny man
I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I cant because—
Diamonds are forever forever forever
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever Forever ever Ever ever Ever ever
Ever ever Ever ever Ever ever
I was sick about awards couldnt nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein theres no convincin him
What more could you ask for The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldnt change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game he made his own lane
Now all I need is yall to pronounce my name
Its Kanye but some of my plaques they still say Kayne
Got family in the D Kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi them Folks aint from Moe Town
Life movin too fast I need to slow down
Girl aint give me no ass you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call you got a message then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw em up like you bulimic
Yeah the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit it sound like the best of
ARs lookin like Pssh we messed up
Grammy night damn right we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle til we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe yeah he next up
People askin me if Im gon give my chain back
Thatll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog Yo where Dame at
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
Whats up with you and Jay man Are yall okay man
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
Rrrrright here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
Diamonds are forever forever forever
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever Forever ever Ever ever Ever ever
Ever ever Ever ever Ever ever
Diamonds are forever forever forever
Diamonds are forever forever forever forever

They said the best classes go to the fastest sorry Mr West
Theres no good classes and thats what yo ass get
Not even electives Not even prerequisites
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds
Now Im in the shop class or the basket weavin
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin
Man this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if Im too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo
Like old folks pissin I guess it all depends oh oh
Stop your cryin baby
Ill be late for that baby Ill wait for that
If you had a taste of that youd probably pay for that
Im comin in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
Ill be late for that I cant wait for that

Thats right thats right thats right thats right
And when you get back she gon start up a fight
That night that night that night
Baby its too late for that lately Ive been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them Eskimos what would you do for a Klondike
Or two dykes that look Christina Milianlike
Hmm Ill be on time for that
I aint thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo Ill be there in five minutes five hours later
Ill be there in five minutes go head ride with it
Im so live with it look how I did it
Been bullshittin but I finally arrived with it
I know its late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin cause Im finally here yeah
Uh uh lets take it back to basics
When shit gets worse we converse
How we need a new balance
Before the lines get crossed like Asics
Just look at what we got if we dont shoot the Reeboks
This is a beat that no flow can detox
So the respect is due like my Louie back
I dont wanna have to check you
Im Chi as BuckFiftys and Pelle Pelle leathers
Some say my beats made the Bulls play better
I say black on black is the hate that hate made
Sara Lee with the dough Im talkin bout the cake maid
McDonalds with the flow served over a billion
Youve seen the video words over the building
Uh I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give you this feeling
And when the Workout Plan aint work out man
Me and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner
Uh yeah uh yeah uhuh uhuh
I open my eyes the corner is like African tribes
The black is subsidized the black enterprise the passion arise
The youth fantasize who got some cash in they eyes
If youth dies mamas askin rationalize
Tryna build a spot where ghetto bastards could rise
The ghetto has been bastardized by those that capitalize
Wonder if its a plan that the master devised
To bring his people to a land where the blacks are despised
On the corner
Breaking up We can make it better
Breaking up We can make it better
Breaking up We can make it better
Make It Up We can make it
Somebody told me Deltas brownskinned AKAs lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougie so they got white friends
First day of school Ima take you sight seein
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said I know what you about to say like your hype man
Last year a nigga hit her and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her its frightenin but
Breaking up We can make it better better we can
Breaking up We can make it better
Better we can make it on up we can
Breaking up We can make it better better we can
Breaking up We can make it
The night fallin over Brooklyn where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drug dealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame you heard of the name
Kweli the truth like Im comin out the mouths of babes
One foot in and one foot out the grave niggas want they reparations how you calculate the amount to be paid
You try to imagine America without the slaves The slaves
Breaking up We can make it better better we can
Breaking up We can make it better
Better we can make it on up we can
Breaking up We can make it better better we can
Breaking up We can make it
Good looks Ye Her tenement yo is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold bullion because she went and protested
Cause her best friends man got popped
He was sixteen years old the cop thought his phone was a Glock
In the hood is an everyday happenin
In front of the precinct she chews out the captain
She yells out Why yall do this to black men Cmon
Breaking up We can make it better better we can
Breaking up We can make it better
Better we can make it on up we can
Breaking up We can make it better better we can
Breaking up We can make it
I think of eightyseven ways to make better days
Whether crime or rhyme I heard the rebel pays
On the scene tryin to get green like everglades
The music ridin it good like Escalades
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And niggas wit thangs aint afraid of karma
Im thinkin big like Lil Wayne and Tha Carterss that
Breaking up We can make it better better we can
Breaking up We can make it better
Better we can make it on up we can
Breaking up We can make it better better we can
Breaking up We can make it

But she wont drop out her parentsll look at her funny
Now tell me that aint insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore three yurrs aint picked a carurr
She like Fuck it Ill just stay down hurr and do hair
Cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs cause her baby daddy dont really care
Shes so precious with the peer pressure
Couldnt afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealin with some issues that you cant believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well
Oh when it all it all falls down
And when it falls down who you gon call now

I cant even pronounce nothin pass that Versaysee
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like Nigga you aint up on this
And I cant even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest selfesteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us floss cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper look how low well stoop
Even if you in a Benz you still a nigga in a coupe
Oh when it all it all falls down
Come on come on

And when it falls down who you gon call now
Oh when it all it all falls down

We buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom
Well buy a lot of clothes but we dont really need em
Things we buy to cover up whats inside
Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
Thats why shortys hollerin Where the ballers at
Drug dealer buy Jordan crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I aint even gon act holier than thou

Before I had a house and Id do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106  Park pushin a Benz

After I fuck the manager up
Then Im gonna shorten the register up
Lets go back back to the Gap
Look at my check wasnt no scratch
So if I stole wasnt my fault
Yeah I stole never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye
Lets put him all in the front of the store
So Im on break next to the No Smoking sign
With a blunt in the mall
Takin my hits writin my hits
Writin my rhymes playin my mind
This fuckin job cant help him
So I quit yall welcome
Yall dont know my struggle
Yall cant match my hustle you cant catch my hustle
You cant fathom my love dude lock yourself in a room
Doin 5 beats a day for 3 summers
Thats A Different World like Cree Summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
Im just waitin on my spaceship
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
And I didnt even try to work a job
Represent the mob at the same time
Thirsty on the grind Chi state of mind
Lost my momma lost my mind
Life my love thats not mine
Why you aint signed Wasnt my time
Leave me alone work for yall
Half of its yours half of its mine
Only one to ball never one to fall
Gotta get mine gotta take mine
Got a Tec9 reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall till 12 when my schedule had said 9
Puttin them pants on shelves waitin patiently I ask myself
Where I wanna go where I wanna be
Life is much more than runnin in the streets
Holla at Ye hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet sound so sweet
Yes Im the same ol G same goatee stayin low key nope
Holler at God Man whyd you have to take my folks
Hope to see Freddie G Yusef G love my G
Rolly G police watch me smoke my weed count my Gs
Got a lot of people countin on me
And Im just tryin to find my peace
Shouldve finished school like my niece
Then I finally wouldnt use my piece blaow
Aww man this pressure
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I member havin to take the dollar cab
Comin home real late at night
Standin on my feet all damn day
Tryin to make this thing right
And havin one of my coworkers say Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night
Well easy come easy go how that saying goes
No more broad service cars and them TV shows
I had all that snatched from me
ARs and they faculties all turn their back on me
And didnt want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me
Cause nothings there nothings fair
I dont wanna ever go back there
So I wont be takin no days off til my spaceship takes off
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I wanna fly I wanna fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me brother for a ride
We at war
We at war with terrorism racism
But most of all we at war with ourselves
Jesus walk
God show me the way because the Devils tryna break me down
Jesus walk with me
You know what the Midwest is Young and restless
Where restless Niggas might snatch your necklace
And next these Niggas might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these Niggas who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless gasps
Try to catch it gasps its kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives yeah yeah now check the method
They be askin us questions harass and arrest us
Sayin We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast
Huh Yall eat pieces of shit Whats the basis
We aint going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But Ill be gone til November I got packs to move
I hope
Jesus walk
God show me the way because the Devils tryna break me down
Jesus walk with me
The only thing that I pray is that my feet dont fail me now
Jesus walk
And I dont think theres nothin I can do now to right my wrongs
Jesus walk with me
I wanna talk to God but Im afraid cause we aint spoke in so long
Jesus walk
God show me the way because the Devils tryna break me down
Jesus walk with me
The only thing that I pray is that my feet dont fail me now
Jesus walk
And I dont think theres nothin I can do now to right my wrongs
Jesus walk with me
I wanna talk to God but Im afraid cause we aint spoke in so long
So long so long
Jesus walk with me
To the hustlers killers murderers drug dealers even the scrippers
Jesus walks for them
To the victims of welfare feel we livin in Hell here hell yeah
Jesus walks for them
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
Cause were the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models we rap we dont think
I aint here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
Im just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis thats the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dawg radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns sex lies videotape
But if I talk about God my record wont get played huh
Well if this take away from my spins
Whichll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that Im dreamin about
Next time Im in the club everybody screamin out
Jesus walk
God show me the way because the Devils tryna break me down
Jesus walk with me
The only thing that I pray is that my feet dont fail me now
When it comes to being true at least true to me
One thing Ive found one thing I found
Oh no youll never let me down
Get up I get down get up I get down
Get up I get down get up I get down
Get up I get down get up I get down
Yo first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear now I have they heart
Rappers came and went Ive been here from the start
I seen them put it together watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them repod resold then redriven
So when I reload he holds number one position
When you hot Im hot
And when your feet cold mines is sizzling
Its plain to see niggas cant fuck with me
cause Ima be that nigga for life
This is not an image this is Godgiven
This is hardlivin mixed with Cristal sippin
Its the most consistent Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga Im home on these charts yall niggas visitin
Its Hov tradition Jeff Gordon of rap
Im back to claim pole position holla at ya boy
When it comes to being true at least true to me
One thing Ive found one thing I found
Oh no youll never let me down
Get up I get down get up I get down
Get up I get down get up I get down
Get up I get down get up
I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sitins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacobs and to the dealership
Thats why I hear new music and I just dont be feelin it
Racisms still alive they just be concealin it
But I know they dont want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear Ive been baptized least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girls father passed away
So I promised to Mr Rainey Im gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side
When it comes to being true at least true to me
One thing Ive found one thing I found
Oh no youll never let me down
Get up I get down get up I get down
Get up I get down get up I get down

We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You dont need a curriculum to know that youre a part of the math
Cats think Im delirious but Im so damn serious
Thats why I expose my soul to the globe the world
Im trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
Im not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this thats why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So its not me its He thats lyrical
Im not a miracle Im a heavensent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
Thats why Im instrumental vibrations is what Im into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that aint what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
Im trying to get us us free like Cinque
I cant stop thats why Im hot
Determination dedication motivation
Im talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I cant let you or selfdown
If I were on the highest cliff on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that Gods penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
Thats why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess Im one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take em to church
When it comes to being true at least true to me
One thing I found one thing I found
Oh no youll never let me down
Get up I get get up I get
Get up I get get up I get
Get up I get get up I get down
Who else you know been hot this long

Right down to the wire even through the fire
Yknow what Im sayin
When the doctor told me I had um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin I said
Dawg dont you realize Ill never make it on a plane now
Its bad enough I got all this jewelry on
You cant be serious man

Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face

Monkey bread on the side know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard have to look all through it
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast
Who knew Id have to look at you through a glass
And look you tell me you aint did it then you aint did it
And if you did then thats family business
And I dont care bout

Rain rain rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain rain rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin sun
All my niggas from the Chi thats my family dog
And my niggas aint my guys they my family dog
I feel like one day youll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You aint got to get heated at every house warmin

And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isnt

The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Aint nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin all the good beats for himself
RocAFellas only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Pauls goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air here
They say he bougie he bigheaded
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious give me 10 seconds
Ill have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
Its funny how wasnt nobody interested
Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

Heres to RocAFella
Raise your glasses your glasses your glasses to the sky and
Heres to the Roc

Now was Kanye the most overlooked Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
Thatll take Freeway throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwali or Kweli I put him on songs with JAYZ
Im the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as BunB when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him  ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous now everybody love Kanye
Im almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant can yall blame him
It was straight embarrassing how yall played him
Last year shoppin my demo I was tryin to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldnt rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas so they say that Im gassed
But without it Id be last so I ought to laugh
So I dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you cant dress no more
You cant say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20000 people I was just on tour nigga
Im Kon the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I aint play the hand I was dealt I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
Oh my god is that a black card
I turned around and replied Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express
Brains power and muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle you know what Ive been up to
Killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaisecolored Benz I push Miracle Whips
And I am
Heres to the Roc
And they ask me they ask me they ask me I tell them

So get your ass up off the wall
So this AR over at RocAFella named Hip Hop Picked the Truth beat for Beanie And I was in the session with him I had my demo with me You know like I always do I play the songs hes like Who that spittin Im like Its me Hes like Oh well okay
Uhh he started talkin to me on the phone going back and forth
Just askin me to send him beats and Im thinking hes trying to get into managing producers cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with
So wont you raise your glass wont you
So wont you raise your glass wont you
So wont you raise your glass wont you
So wont you raise your glass wont you
And um he was friends with my mentor No ID And No ID told him Look man you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap
No ID Yo you wanna sign him tell him you like how he rap
I was all I dunno if he was gassin me or not but hes like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer
Im like oh shit I was messin with uh DDot also People were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats how I got in the game If it wasnt for that I wouldnt be here So you know after they picked that Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasnt poppin off like that I was stayin in Chicago I had my own apartment I be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a Pelle Pelle off layaway get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine thats what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone hes like Oh yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called The Dynasty And at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me So I went and um I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time And really I just like bit the drums off Xxplosive and put it like with a spedup sample and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on This Cant Be Life
And that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I I just needed some fresh air you know what Im sayin cause I been there for a while I appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change Try to move up to the next level And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAYZ and he said Oh you a real soulful dude
And he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio You know how he do it one take And he said
Tell me what you think of this And I heard it and I was thinking like man I really wanted more like of the simple type JAYZ I aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the in my personal opinion So he asked me What you think of it
And I was like Man that shit tight you know what Im sayin man what Ima tell him I was on the train man you know So after that I went back home And man Im Im just in Chicago Im trying to do my thing You know I got groups I got acts Im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been One of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed But it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company So like Im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company And I got evicted at the same time So I went down and tracked the beats from him I took that money came back packed all my shit up in a UHaul maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk Me and my mother drove to
Newark New Jersey I hadnt even seen my apartment I remember I pulled up
I unpacked all my shit You know we went to Ikea I bought a bed I put the bed together myself I loaded up all my equipment and the first beat I made was uh Heart of the City And Beans was still working on his album at that time so I came up there to Baseline it was Beans birthday matter of fact and I played like seven beats And you know I guess he was in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted I had did Nothing Like It already at that time but then Jay walked in I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on I remember it like like it was yesterday And Hiphop said Yo play that one beat for him And I played Heart of the City And really I made Heart of the City I really wanted to give that beat to DMX
And I played another beat and I played another beat And I remember that Gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like OOOOOOOOOOH Two days later Im in Baseline and I seen Dame Dame didnt know who I was and I was like Yo whats up Im Kanye
You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay Yo this nigga got classics to your beats
You know I aint talkin shit Im like oh shit And all this time Im starstruck man Im still thinking bout you know Im picturing these niggas on the show The Streets is Watching Im lookin these were superstars in my eyes And they still are you know So Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days I gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story the day I did the Cant be Life beat on track I remember Lenny S he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on he think he fly And Hip Hop was there I think TyTy John Meneilly a bunch of people I didnt know all these people at the time they was in the room and I said yo Jay I could rap And I spit this rap that said uh Im killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit Mayonnaise colored Benz I push miracle whips And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line But you know the rest the rap was like real wack and shit so thats all the response He said Man that was tight
That was it You know I aint get no deal then hehe Okay fast forward So Blueprint H to the Izzo my first hit single And I just took that proudly built relationships with people My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper Because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him Man I appre I love him for that And at this time you know I didnt have a deal I had songs and I had relationships with all these ARs and they wanted beats from me so theyd call me up Id play them some beats Gimme a beat that sound like JAYZ You know they dick riders Whatever So Ill play them these postBlueprint beats or whatever and then Ill play my shit Ill be like yo but I rap too Hey I guess they was lookin at me crazy cause you know cause I aint have a jersey on or whatever Everybody out there listen here I played them Jesus Walks and they didnt sign me You know what happened it was some ARs that fucked with me though but then like the heads itd be somebody at the company thatll say Naw Like Dave Lighty fucked with me my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels Jessica Rivera man
Im not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up
Lets just say I didnt get my deal The nigga that was behind me I mean he wasnt even a nigga you know The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records He wanted to sign me really bad
Dame was like Yo you got a deal with Capitol Okay man just make sure its not wack
Then one day I just went ahead and played it I wanted to play some songs cause you know Cam was in the room Young Guru and Dame was in the room So I played actually its a song that youll never hear but maybe I might use it So its called Wow
I go to Jacob with 25 thou you go with 25 hundred wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single damn nigga wow
Like the chorus went Dont bite that chorus I might still use it So I play that song for him and hes like oh shit
I aint gonna front its kinda hot
Like they still werent looking at me like a rapper And Im sure Dame figured Like man If he do a whole album if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album you know So uh Dame took me into the office and hes like yo man B B you dont want a brick you dont want a brick
You gotta be under an umbrella youll get rained on I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all oh word Actually even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H That you know cause I told him I was gonna do it and Im a man of my word I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do Then you know Im not gonna name no names but people told me oh hes just a producerrapper and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol and right the day Im talking about I planned out everything I was gonna do Man I had picked out clothes I already started booking studio sessions I started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes man I was ready to go And they had Mel call me they said yo Capitol pulled on the deal
And you know I told them that RocAFella was interested and I dont know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever I went up I called G I said man you think we could still get that deal with RocAFella
So wont you raise your glass wont you
So wont you raise your glass wont you
So wont you raise your glass wont you
So wont you raise your glass wont you
