# ðŸŽ¤ Kanye vs Taylor Lyric Classifier

This project is a web-based lyric classification tool that predicts whether a given lyric line was written by **Kanye West** or **Taylor Swift**. It uses two different machine learning models:

- **TF-IDF + SVM**
- **Word2Vec + SVM**

Built using Python, scikit-learn, Flask, and Gensim.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

### 1. TF-IDF + SVM
TF-IDF stands for **Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency**. It gives higher weight to rare but significant words that appear frequently in one artist's lyrics but rarely in the other's.

- Each lyric line is transformed into a **sparse vector** using TF-IDF.
- A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier is trained to distinguish between Kanye and Taylor lyrics based on these features.
- Particularly effective for **highlighting rare, discriminative words** (e.g., proper nouns, slang, stylistic phrases).
- This model has a slight bias towards Kanye, as Kanye uses a lot more distinct words in his lyrics. 

### 2. Word2Vec + SVM
Word2Vec transforms words into dense **300-dimensional vectors** based on their meanings and usage context, trained on the Google News dataset.

- Each lyric line is tokenized, and the vectors of all words are **averaged** to get a single vector.
- An SVM classifier is trained on these averaged vectors.
- Captures **semantic meaning** rather than raw word frequencies.
- Sometimes more subtle, but **less effective at highlighting rare or class-unique words** (e.g., the N-word).
